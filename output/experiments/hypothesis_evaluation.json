  "reasoning": "The hypothesis states that RBQL converges to optimal policies faster than standard Q-learning in deterministic, episodic environments by leveraging a persistent world model and backward reward propagation. The results show that RBQL has an average convergence of 93.97 episodes with a standard deviation of 31.24, while Q-learning has an average convergence of 233.60 episodes with a standard deviation of 86.91. A t-test confirms statistical significance (t=-8.1416, p=3.5475e-11), meaning the difference is highly unlikely to be due to chance. The plot captions also explicitly state that RBQL achieves the success threshold much faster and demonstrates superior sample efficiency. These results directly support the hypothesis's claims about faster convergence due to backward reward propagation in deterministic environments."
