Recursive Backwards Q-Learning (\ac{RBQL}) demonstrates over 60\% faster convergence to optimal policy performance than standard Q-learning in deterministic, episodic environments by exploiting deterministic dynamics through backward reward propagation via a persistent transition model. This mechanism enables exact Bellman backups with $\alpha=1$ after each episode, eliminating the need for repeated state-action visits and transforming episodic exploration into an online dynamic programming procedure. The approach is directly applicable to robotics, game AI, and planning systems where environment dynamics are known or learnable, offering a practical path to sample-efficient learning without reward shaping or prior model knowledge \cite{Diekhoff2024RecursiveBQ}. A promising next step is extending \ac{RBQL} to stochastic environments by incorporating weighted backward propagation based on empirical transition frequencies.
