    "summary": "Long-separated research has been conducted on two highly correlated tracks: traffic and incidents. Traffic track witnesses complicating deep learning models, e.g., to push the prediction a few percent more accurate, and the incident track only studies the incidents alone, e.g., to infer the incident risk. We, for the first time, spatiotemporally aligned the two tracks in a large-scale region (16,972 traffic nodes) over the whole year of 2023: our XTraffic dataset includes traffic, i.e., time-series indexes on traffic flow, lane occupancy, and average vehicle speed, and incidents, whose records are spatiotemporally-aligned with traffic data, with seven different incident classes. Additionally, each node includes detailed physical and policy-level meta-attributes of lanes. Our data can revolutionalize traditional traffic-related tasks towards higher interpretability and practice: instead of traditional prediction or classification tasks, we conduct: (1) post-incident traffic forecasting to quantify the impact of different incidents on traffic indexes; (2) incident classification using traffic indexes to determine the incidents types for precautions measures; (3) global causal analysis among the traffic indexes, meta-attributes, and incidents to give high-level guidance of the interrelations of various factors; (4) local causal analysis within road nodes to examine how different incidents affect the road segments' relations. The dataset is available at http://xaitraffic.github.io.",

    "summary": "Timely forecasting of aboveground vegetation biomass is crucial for effective management and ensuring food security. However, research on predicting aboveground biomass remains scarce. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods could bridge this research gap and provide early warning to planners and stakeholders. This study evaluates the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) algorithms in predicting aboveground vegetation biomass with limited-size data. It employs an iterative forecasting procedure for four target horizons, comparing the performance of DL models—multi-layer perceptron (MLP), long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), convolutional neural network (CNN), and CNN-LSTM—against the traditional seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model, serving as a benchmark. Five limited-size vegetation biomass time series from Kenyan grasslands with values at 15-day intervals over a 20-year period were chosen for this purpose. Comparing the outcomes of these models revealed significant differences (p < 0.05); however, none of the models proved superior among the five time series and the four horizons evaluated. The SARIMA, CNN, and CNN-LSTM models performed best, with the statistical model slightly outperforming the other two. Additionally, the accuracy of all five models varied significantly according to the prediction horizon (p < 0.05). As expected, the accuracy of the models decreased as the prediction horizon increased, although this relationship was not strictly monotonic. Finally, this study indicated that, in limited-size aboveground vegetation biomass time series, there is no guarantee that deep learning methods will outperform traditional statistical methods.",

    "summary": "This study explores market efficiency and behavior by integrating key theories such as the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH), Adaptive Market Hypothesis (AMH), Informational Efficiency and Random Walk theory. Using LSTM enhanced by optimizers like Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, AdaGrad, and RMSprop, we analyze market inefficiencies in the Standard and Poor’s (SPX) index over a 22-year period. Our results reveal “pockets in time” that challenge EMH predictions, particularly with the AdaGrad optimizer at a size of the hidden layer (HS) of 64. Beyond forecasting, we apply the Dominguez–Lobato (DL) and General Spectral (GS) tests as part of the Martingale Difference Hypothesis to assess statistical inefficiencies and deviations from the Random Walk model. By emphasizing “informational efficiency”, we examine how quickly new information is reflected in stock prices. We argue that market inefficiencies are transient phenomena influenced by structural shifts and information flow, challenging the notion that forecasting alone can refute EMH. Additionally, we compare LSTM with ARIMA with Exponential Smoothing, and LightGBM to highlight the strengths and limitations of these models in financial forecasting. The LSTM model excels at capturing temporal dependencies, while LightGBM demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting non-linear relationships. Our comprehensive approach offers a nuanced understanding of market dynamics and inefficiencies.",

    "summary": "Groundwater is regarded as the primary source of agricultural and drinking water in semi-arid and arid regions. However, toxic substances released from sources such as landfills, industries, insecticides, and fertilizers from the previous year exhibited extreme levels of groundwater contamination. As a result, it is crucial to assess the quality of the groundwater for agricultural and drinking activities, both its current use and its potential to become a reliable water supply for individuals. The quality of the groundwater is critical in Egypt’s Sohag region because it serves as a major alternative source of agricultural activities and residential supplies, in addition to providing drinking water, and residents there frequently have issues with the water’s suitability for human consumption. This research assesses groundwater quality and future forecasting using Deep Learning Time Series Techniques (DLTS) and long short-term memory (LSTM) in Sohag, Egypt. Ten groundwater quality parameters (pH, Sulfate, Nitrates, Magnesium, Chlorides, Iron, Total Coliform, TDS, Total Hardness, and Turbidity) at the seven pumping wells were used in the analysis to create the water quality index (WQI). The model was tested and trained using actual data over nine years from seven wells in Sohag, Egypt. The high quantities of iron and magnesium in the groundwater samples produced a high WQI. The proposed forecasting model provided good performances in terms of average mean-square error (MSE) and average root-mean-square error (RMSE) with values of 1.6091 × 10−7 and 4.0114 × 10−4, respectively. The WQI model’s findings demonstrated that it could assist managers and policymakers in better managing groundwater resources in arid areas.",

    "summary": "With the advancement of deep learning algorithms and the growing availability of computational power, deep learning-based forecasting methods have gained significant importance in the domain of time series forecasting. In the past decade, there has been a rapid rise in time series forecasting approaches. This paper comprehensively reviews the advancements in deep learning-based forecasting models spanning 2014 to 2024. We provide a comprehensive examination of the capabilities of these models in capturing correlations among time steps and time series variables. Additionally, we explore methods to enhance the efficiency of long-term time series forecasting and summarize the diverse loss functions employed in these models. Moreover, this study systematically evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches in both univariate and multivariate time series forecasting tasks across diverse domains. We comprehensively discuss the strengths and limitations of various algorithms from multiple perspectives, analyze their capacity to capture different types of time series information, including trend and season patterns, and compare methods for enhancing the computational efficiency of these models. Finally, we summarize the experimental results and discuss the future directions in time series forecasting.
