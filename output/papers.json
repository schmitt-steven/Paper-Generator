    "summary": "Mean field games (MFGs) are a promising framework for modeling the behavior of large-population systems. However, solving MFGs can be challenging due to the coupling of forward population evolution and backward agent dynamics. Typically, obtaining mean field Nash equilibria (MFNE) involves an iterative approach where the forward and backward processes are solved alternately, known as fixed-point iteration (FPI). This method requires fully observed population propagation and agent dynamics over the entire spatial domain, which could be impractical in some real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces a novel online single-agent model-free learning scheme, which enables a single agent to learn MFNE using online samples, without prior knowledge of the state-action space, reward function, or transition dynamics. Specifically, the agent updates its policy through the value function (Q), while simultaneously evaluating the mean field state (M), using the same batch of observations. We develop two variants of this learning scheme: off-policy and on-policy QM iteration. We prove that they efficiently approximate FPI, and a sample complexity guarantee is provided. The efficacy of our methods is confirmed by numerical experiments.",

    "summary": "\n 16\n \n \n Background:\n Adjuvant RIB + a nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2024 for pts with HR+/HER2− stage II/III EBC at high risk of recurrence, including select node-negative and all node-positive pts. The clinical benefit of RIB was observed in the overall pt population and pts aged ≥65. Previous modeling analyses showed long-term benefit and economic value of adjuvant RIB + NSAI vs NSAI in the overall pt population. Given the notable proportion of older pts with EBC and the unmet need, this study aimed to assess long-term cost-effectiveness among pts aged ≥65 from a US Medicare perspective.\n Methods:\n A Markov model was developed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of RIB + NSAI vs NSAI over a lifetime horizon, including 4 health states: invasive disease–free (IDF), locoregional recurrence (LR), distant recurrence (DR), and death. Transition probabilities between health states were estimated using NATALEE data observed over 4.5y for the ≥65 subgroup and parametric extrapolation afterwards. Treatment (tx) effect waning was applied (starting at 10y and ending at 15y), informed by clinical opinion and literature. Drug acquisition costs associated with adjuvant, LR, and DR tx; adverse event (AE) costs; disease management costs; and terminal care costs were estimated based on publicly available data sources, NATALEE, and literature. Health state utilities were based on EQ-5D-5L data in NATALEE; AE disutilities were obtained from literature. Lifetime costs, life years (LYs), quality-adjusted LYs (QALYs), and equal value of LYs (evLYs) that reflect gains in LYs at the full value of a healthy year of life irrespective of age, disability, or illness, were considered. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) between RIB + NSAI vs NSAI were calculated. Sensitivity analyses explored variability in key parameters.\n Results:\n Compared with NSAI, RIB + NSAI was estimated to extend survival by an average of 0.81y and evLYs and QALYs by 0.85y and 0.77y, respectively. Pts receiving RIB + NSAI incurred higher adjuvant tx costs offset by lower costs for LR tx, DR tx, disease management for LR and DR, and terminal care. Lifetime total costs for pts receiving RIB + NSAI were lower ($607,735) than for those receiving NSAI ($610,975), per-pt savings of $3,240. Thus, RIB + NSAI was dominant vs NSAI. Scenario analyses supported the base-case findings, with either dominant results or ICERs below $150,000.\n Conclusions:\n Among pts aged ≥65, RIB + NSAI extended survival and demonstrated cost-effectiveness over a lifetime horizon compared with NSAI alone, consistent with the overall pt population. Early use of RIB + NSAI offered substantial clinical and economic benefits for older pts with HR+/HER2− EBC by reducing risk of recurrence.\n",

    "summary": "Agricultural droughts often disrupt cropping patterns in the rain‐scarce regions of Ethiopia. Understanding their temporal trends and geographical variations can greatly aid farmers in planning their farming activities. This paper examines the temporal trends, geographical extent, and severity of agricultural droughts in the Tekeze watershed, Ethiopia. Data were acquired from MODIS NDVI using the Earth Engine Data Catalogue and from the Central Statistics Agency (CSA) of Ethiopia. The normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI), enhanced vegetation index (EVI), vegetation condition index (VCI) and Random Forest Regression model were used for data analysis. Findings showed that August and September sustained the highest vegetation cover and health, whilst June and July had the lowest. Over the 24‐year period analysed using the VCI, 14 years experienced drought conditions, with areal coverage percentages ranging from 52.45% in 2003 to 78.1% in 2015. The temporal EVI values show that all the years of the study period fall under mild drought conditions on average. Spatially, the EVI drought ranges from 66.1% in 2023 to 82.1% of the total area in 2014. The integrated drought class map created using weighted overlay analysis showed three drought categories (moderate, mild & no drought; consistently covering 0.38%, 63.9% and 35.9% of the area). Over 50% of the area was found affected by various drought levels for several years. The analysis of all indices indicates that the drought recurrence period is approximately 2 years, suggesting a deteriorating situation over time. The EVI analysis indicated that all the summer months during the study period were facing mild droughts, and none of the area was totally free from droughts. Furthermore, NDVI, EVI and VCI were moderately correlated with crop yields, explaining approximately 66%–73% of the variations observed in crop performance. These numerical results highlight the severity and distribution of drought conditions in the watershed. These results not only highlight the urgent need for effective drought management strategies but also stress the importance of continuous monitoring and adaptive planning for farmers in order to mitigate the adverse effects on crop yields.",

    "summary": "Over the last decade, China’s property market has undergone pronounced cyclical shifts, transitioning from sustained growth to a marked slowdown following macroeconomic shocks in late 2021. These structural adjustments—shaped by evolving regulatory interventions and growing fiscal uncertainty—have posed complex forecasting challenges for stakeholders such as institutional investors, governmental regulators, and urban development planners charged with anticipating metropolitan housing value trends. To address the shortcomings of traditional prediction techniques, this research introduces an advanced framework based on Gaussian process regression, enhanced by adaptable kernel configurations and tailored feature engineering underpinned by domain expertise. The framework analyzes the temporal evolution of housing prices in Lijiang, Yunnan Province, utilizing a 9-year panel dataset spanning October 2015 to July 2024. By integrating Bayesian hyperparameter tuning with nested cross-validation, the model achieved substantial out-of-sample accuracy gains for October 2022 to July 2024, registering a relative root mean square error of 0.1209%. These results confirm the method’s ability to capture complex nonlinear dynamics and enrich spatial economic theory by revealing how local governance structures interact with price-setting mechanisms. Its modular architecture enables seamless coupling with additional econometric models or standalone applications across diverse urban contexts, offering scalable, evidence-based tools for policy decision-makers. Moreover, the findings provide strategic insights for designing adaptive regulatory frameworks, thereby linking this work to practical urban governance.",

    "summary": "INTRODUCTION: According to international and domestic clinical guidelines for assessing the response to treatment in patients with lymphomas according to PET/CT with FDG uses a 5-point PET scale based on changes in the level of uptake of RFLP in tumor masses. Of particular interest when using this scale are 3 points due to the difficulties in interpreting the data obtained in patients when assessing the prognosis of the disease.OBJECTIVE: Тo calculate and compare such metabolic quantities as the level of FDH absorption and tumor volume in patients with different periods of ED who had 3 points on the PET scale after treatment. Statistics: The MTV was determined using specialized software installed on the AW 4.7 (GE) workstation. The algorithm is an iterative mechanism for classifying the tumor/background within a selected area, applying a tissue weighting coefficient (w) to the SUV MAX values, set by default at 0.5 damage. Logistic regression was used to perform multifactorial analysis and build diagnostic models. The significance of regression coefficients was analyzed, and the odds ratio (OR) and the 95% confidence interval for it were estimated for significant regressors. A ROC analysis was performed to compare the quality of the forecast and select the best models.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 97 patients with a score of 3 on the PET scale after treatment. In all patients, the tumor volume and the level of RF absorption were calculated in order to compare them. The Kruskal–Wallis test was used for comparative evaluation. The differences were considered statistically significant at the level of p < 0.05.RESULTS: As a result, the calculation and comparison of the averages of these values were carried out. In patients who underwent PFS for more than two years (n=69), the minimum average value of RF absorption was recorded when comparing the indicators before and during treatment, the difference was 6.5; the maximum average value of RF absorption was observed when comparing the indicators after and during treatment, the difference was 10.8, which is equivalent to 77.1% and 42.3% accordingly. The indicators of RF absorption and tumor volume differ statistically significantly depending on the following pairs of variables: %SUVperv/prom and %SUVperv/otv (p=0.016); %SUVperv/prom and %SUVprom/otv (p=0.045); %MTVperv/prom and % ΔMTVperv/rel (p=0.05).DISCUSSION: The main differences and at the same time advantages of our study from those presented above are a wider range of included types of lymphomas, in the study of S. Semary et al. (2024) this is only Hodgkin’s lymphoma, in the study of X. Li et al. (2020), David Z. Ng et al. (2022) this is only diffuse B-cell lymphoma, and in the study of H. Y. Yhim et al. (2018) this is peripheral T-cell lymphoma, at the same time, our study includes not only these types, but also follicular lymphoma and mantle zone lymphoma, which blurs the boundaries for expanding the scope of the results. In addition, these studies are based either on an assessment of the prognostic value of the scale itself, that is, on an assessment of only the result — 3 points, or on the use of the result — 3 points and the level of accumulation of RFLP, which distinguishes our study by using and evaluating not only the level of accumulation of RFLP, but also the tumor volume, which, according to X. Li et al. (2020), along with other quantitative values, will not only be more easily reproducible and comparable compared to the 5-point PET scale, but also more effective. In addition, in his opinion, they may turn out to be more accurate. I would also like to note that in our study we did not evaluate the three–year PFS or OS in patients with 3 and 4 points, but drew attention to a shorter period — two-year PFS and only in patients with 3 points on the PET scale, which, in our opinion, is also no less relevant.CONCLUSION: As a result, it was found that patients with a period of PFS of more than 24 months have statistically significant differences in both parameters, which can be used as an additional factor in predicting the disease.",

    "summary": "Abstract. The end-of-summer Arctic Ocean is projected to face at least one occurrence of practically ice-free conditions (sea ice extent <1×106 km2) by the middle of the century under all Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) scenarios. Climate models indicate that this transition toward a practically ice-free Arctic Ocean in late summer will be punctuated by rapid ice loss events (RILEs), i.e., year-to-year reductions in total sea ice extent that occur at a much faster rate than expected from the forced contribution. The extreme sea ice loss associated with RILEs in climate models exceeds any observed rates of sea ice loss since the start of the satellite era, including the highest observed rate of -0.28×106 km2 yr−1 during 2001–2008. As such, there could be a much faster transition toward practically ice-free conditions than expected based on a linear trend of past observations. However, RILEs are not well understood, and it is currently impossible to predict their occurrence a season to several years ahead. It is therefore essential to improve our understanding of these events. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of RILEs in a diverse set of 26 CMIP6 models, including five large ensembles, following both low- and high-warming scenarios over the period from 1970 to 2100. Our analysis shows that RILEs are expected to occur year-round, but the timing and duration of these events are found to be season-dependent, with less frequent but longer-lived RILEs in winter and spring and more frequent but shorter-lived RILEs in summer and fall under a high-emission scenario. In addition, we find that the warming scenario has a greater influence on RILE characteristics in the winter–spring season than in the summer–fall season. Our results also emphasize that model uncertainty is larger regarding the probability and characteristics of RILEs for winter–spring events compared to summer–fall ones. Finally, while the initial sea ice extent at which RILEs are triggered depends on whether they occur in September or March, the initial sea ice volume is similar for both months, which emphasizes the critical role of sea ice thickness as a preconditioning factor for RILEs. Based on CMIP6 models, there is an approximately 60 % chance that at least one summer RILE will start in September before 2030. This study of RILEs is particularly opportune as CMIP6 models suggest that, following a period of relative stability in Arctic sea ice, the probability of a rapid sea ice reduction will increase. Given the relatively stable conditions observed between 2015 and 2024, the current summer Arctic sea ice state may have an increased probability of being on the verge of a rapid sea ice loss event.\n",

    "summary": "In recent years, the transition to clean bus fleets has accelerated. Although this transition might bring environmental and economic benefits, it requires a long-term strategic plan due to the large investment costs involved. This paper proposes a multi-stage stochastic program to optimize strategic plans for the clean bus fleet transition that explicitly considers the uncertainty scenarios in the cost and efficiency improvements of clean buses. Our optimization model minimizes the total expected cost subject to emission targets, budget restrictions and several other operational considerations. We propose a new forecasting approach that captures the correlation between these improvements to obtain realistic future pathways for Battery Electric Buses (BEBs) and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Buses (HFCBs), which are then given to the multi-stage stochastic program as scenarios. We also utilize a physics-based model for BEBs to accurately capture their energy consumption and recharging needs. As a case study, we focus on the complex public bus network of Istanbul, which aims to transition to a clean bus fleet by 2050. Utilizing real datasets, we solve a five-stage stochastic program spanning a 25-year planning horizon that involves 256 scenarios to obtain dynamic strategic plans that can be used by the policy makers. Our results suggest that BEBs are more advantageous than HFCBs, even in slow BEB but fast HFCB development scenarios. We also conduct several sensitivity analyses to understand the effects of the intermediate emission targets, budget limitations and energy prices.",

    "summary": "This paper investigates a new approach to model-based reinforcement learning using background planning: mixing (approximate) dynamic programming updates and model-free updates, similar to the Dyna architecture. Background planning with learned models is often worse than model-free alternatives, such as Double DQN, even though the former uses significantly more memory and computation. The fundamental problem is that learned models can be inaccurate and often generate invalid states, especially when iterated many steps. In this paper, we avoid this limitation by constraining background planning to a set of (abstract) subgoals and learning only local, subgoal-conditioned models. This goal-space planning (GSP) approach is more computationally efficient, naturally incorporates temporal abstraction for faster long-horizon planning and avoids learning the transition dynamics entirely. We show that our GSP algorithm can propagate value from an abstract space in a manner that helps a variety of base learners learn significantly faster in different domains.",

    "summary": "Yield forecasting system in discrete manufacturing is a dynamic complex systems with a number of factors, face such a complex and large system is difficult to directly general system to the enterprise, therefore need to give a company's production forecast model. On the background of Wuzhong Instrument company application, this paper by RBF(radical basis function) neural networks and generalized regression neural network algorithm were compared in enterprise applications, to find the most suitable production forecast model in Wuzhong Instrument company, then Analysis and comparison shows the experimental results . The model has been applied to the valve, spool and valve seat yield prediction in the advanced planning and scheduling in which the practical arrangements played a major role for production planning of Wuzhong Instrument company. Introduction Wuzhong Instrument Company is the largest production base of automatic control valve’s research and development in china, meanwhile, has developed into the leader of the application of information technology in the same industry throughout the country[1]. With the increase in production, Wuzhong Instrument production plan has become a major restricted factor of expansion and development. In order to increase accuracy of production capacity forecasting, the domestic and foreign scholars have put forward a lot of production forecasting models[2]. but for discrete manufacturing, with small batch production and multiple species’ features ,the research of automatic adjustment valve prediction are comparatively far less[3].Therefore, we need to create a set of actual production forecasting model to apply in APS(advanced plan system) of Wuzhong Instrument company. Description In order to meet the established production planning and job scheduling needs, it is necessary for Wuzhong Instrument company which is in the condition of many varieties, small batch-to-order model to solve the problems of batch size and delivery date[4]. With the increasingly severe competition of the market, the Wuzhong Instrument Company begins to pay attention to customers’ needs. The production forecasts can predict the peak demand of parts. Then factory can produce some common parts in a relatively low period and reserve them for easing the pressure on the peak of production. Of course, more isn't always better, because warehouse backlog will result in inefficient flow of funds. How to reasonably and accurately predicate production is very important. Analysis of forecasting model Production forecast is that of enterprise according to the existing objective conditions and historical data for the enterprise future development trends and status of the production forecast. 4th International Conference on Mechatronics, Materials, Chemistry and Computer Engineering (ICMMCCE 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 1082 Enterprises also can surplus in production capacity or a large surplus, the company in accordance with \"experience or data support\" to determine and \"moderate\" to arrange some common parts and components to product, in order to avoid wasting manufacturing resources. In addition, post-production also play a relieve pressure[5]. By analyzing the data Wuzhong Instrument factory (2011-2014 year) as well as access to the relevant planning department staff, the indicators Wuzhong Instrument factory production lines were screened to obtain the initial index of production lines. Wuzhong Instrument obtain from the data analysis, the data of a total of 150,000, but only have the 2000 empty data, part of the field is null, the proportion is very small, so we can take the linear interpolation to fill. Data is based on daily production to record in the database , if the forecast according to daily production volume, the result would be very cumbersome and not intuitive analysis of its regularity, so we follow a month (storage date) such time interval data analysis. There are many product categories, so we conducted an analysis of its valve body, valve sleeve and valve core types. (1) Normalization process which can make parameterized in the same range, it can also speed up the training of the network. So before enter the neural network, which is data normalization process, will cover the range of data defined between [0, 1]. Research of yield forecasting model The yield prediction purpose is to use the program inventory to make no direct relationship between the program and decisive orders, making the production plan have some flexibility and adjustability, so as to solve the problem of inadequate capacity utilization, while reducing to a certain extent production cycle. Within a production cycle, when the order volume, resulting in production efforts becomes saturated, if the instruction will continue to release a production, the enterprise production capacity is saturated and lead to production cycles. So when production efforts saturated, it should consume inventory, the number of actual production plans should take a minimum. On the contrary, when the orders is little, the enterprise overcapacity, it should to replenish valve parts in orders to use when production capacity is saturated. (2) T represents minimum inventory than planned over the number of complete or incomplete at year; 1 P represents a reasonable production quantities of the product; 2 P represents the actual level of production of the product; 3 P represents the product of the month inventory; 4 P represents the smallest year inventory. (3) P represents the number of production forecast. RBF hidden units used as \"base\" constitutes the hidden layer space, the input vector is mapped directly to the hidden, after space center confirmation determine the mapping is linear [6] between the hidden layer spaces to the output space mapping. The purpose of RBF neural network output layer and the hidden layer achieved is different, the output layer is linear right adjustments, while the hidden layer of RBF parameters is adjusted, using a nonlinear optimization strategy . min max min i i x x x x x − = − 0 0 0 T P T T  >  = ≤  ( ) ( ) 2 T P P P P = − − − 3 4 1",

    "summary": "\n \n Background\n The period of transition into adulthood represents a critical turning point for adolescent and young adults (AYA) living with sickle cell disease (SCD). Their ability to participate in society and live fulfilling adult lives depends significantly on how this transition is manged (Treadwell et al., Am J Hematol, 2011). Recent medical advancements have facilitated the transition into adulthood for over 85% of children with chronic conditions, necessitating a shift to adult medical services (Wright et al., Curr Opin Pediatr, 2018) Despite this progress, many barriers persist in providing optimal care in the AYA SCD population.We present this methods poster for an AYA SCD transition program currently being implemented within a pediatric medical center as a standard of care.\n Objectives\n Our free-standing pediatric academic center, connected to a large adult hospital, serves approximately 300 sickle cell patients, 33% of whom are AYA (ages 12-30). Through a grant funded by the NYS department of health, we plan to hire a nurse navigator to support a successful transition for our AYA sickle cell disease patients and closely monitor the impact of social determinants of health on these outcomes. As part of implementing this transition program, we aim to characterize the outcomes of AYA sickle cell patients treated in our hospital system's AYA Sickle Cell Transition Clinic and identify clinic-specific and patient-specific indicators of both positive and negative outcomes for these patients through their transition period.\n Study Design/Methods\n We aim to enroll ~75 AYA SCD patients over five years, focusing on those transitioning to adult care within our hospital's SCD clinic. Quarterly monitoring through a transition readiness clinic will provide personalized care with services including medication adherence, medical referrals, and mental health screening. Annual focus groups will address care barriers and outcomes. Our study team will maintain a database to track patient activities and clinical services and monitor progress using the Got Transition Health Care Transition Timeline for Youth and Young Adults (Got Transtion, 2024) to collect variables such as zip code, insurance type, and disease management efficacy markers.\n Data Analysis\n For our methods poster, we will present models of our plan for analysis for a longitudinal, mixed methods study. We plan to conduct regular prospective chart reviews and integrate qualitative data. Preliminary analysis will include descriptive statistics and patient demographics. Qualitative data will be analyzed using inductive content analysis and the constant comparison method, with an evolving code book based on patient focus groups. We plan to analyze long-term health events and compare them with historical data via t-tests. We plan to use regression or chi-square analyses to assess the impact of AYA-specific programming and patient indicators on outcomes. Cross-sectional analysis will be used to explore relationships between medical/psychosocial events and patient demographics. Significant bivariate associations will lead to multivariate analysis adjusting for potential confounders.\n Conclusions\n Advancements in medical care have increased survival rates for children with SCD, creating new challenges and opportunities for AYA treatment (Lanzkron et al., Public Health Rep. 2013). We have proposed one method to integrate a SCD transition program into the daily operations of a SCD clinic. The implications of such a study are wide-ranging, potentially reducing burden on the medical system by decreasing emergency department visits, hospital admissions, and rehospitilizations rates. Implementing this AYA SCD transition program aims to deepen our understanding of social determinants of health and their impact on a successful trnaisoin , identify barriers and facilitators to care, and contribute to the literature on transition care.\n",

    "summary": "Peking Union Medical College Hospital and the University of Chicago have established a robust partnership characterized by collaboration and camaraderie. These two institutions engage in productive interactions and exchanges concerning resident physician training, teaching methodologies, and specialized academic collaborations. In July 2019, Peking Union Medical College Hospital sent senior physicians to the University of Chicago for their inaugural participation in the International Medical Educators Program (IMEP). In 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the IMEP transitioned to an online training format. The IMEP course for 2024 features a hybrid model of both offline and online instruction, marking the return to in-person teaching for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. This year's curriculum primarily emphasizes 'Curriculum Development for Medical Education: A Six-Step Approach.' Furthermore, the organizers have planned a diverse array of teaching topics, including Learning Theory, Clinical Competence Assessment, Outpatient Teaching Skills, Teaching on the Fly, Residents as Teachers, Bedside Teaching Skills, Coaching in Medical Education, Online Teaching Skills, Peer Coaching, and Growth Mindset in a Fixed Mindset Culture. Among the courses that significantly broadened my perspective and deepened my understanding, the lecture delivered by Professor James N. Woodruff from the Pritzker School of Medicine at the University of Chicago, titled 'Growth Mindset in a Fixed Mindset Culture,' left the most profound impression on me. The development of a growth mindset is essential for medical students. Professor Woodruff underscored this point in the course \"Growth Mindset in a Fixed Mindset Culture,\" emphasizing that the future of medical practice will be characterized by complex and dynamic challenges. In this context, errors and mistakes are unavoidable, highlighting the need to shift focus from static abilities to continuous growth. To date, the growth mindset framework established by the Pritzker School of Medicine Well-Being Committee has yielded remarkable results. The successful experience of the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine has prompted me to conduct a more in-depth analysis of our own practices. Specifically, within the Department of Internal Medicine at Peking Union Medical College Hospital, we have encountered some challenges in the standardized training of residents in recent years. Additionally, there has been a notable increase in the emotional challenges faced by residents. Consequently, it is essential to draw lessons from the successful practices of the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and to incorporate growth mindset-related training into our resident training system. This integration aims to enhance residents' abilities to navigate complex situations and solve intricate problems. More importantly, it fosters mental resilience, equipping residents to better manage stress and setbacks. The cultivation of a growth mindset is crucial not only for residents but also for senior physicians, as we all confront the complexities of the medical environment, the uncertainties associated with diseases, and the challenges inherent in our professional development. Effectively addressing these challenges requires the support of a growth mindset.",

    "summary": "Over the past few decades, healthcare project management has changed dramatically, moving from linear to more flexible and technologically integrated models. The dynamic character of healthcare systems and the increasing complexity of project environments are highlighted in this conceptual framework, which also examines the historical development and new paradigms in healthcare project management. In the past, healthcare organizations have used traditional project management techniques like Waterfall and Critical Path Method (CPM), which worked effectively in settings with clear goals. These methods placed a strong emphasis on scope control, sequential execution, and strict planning. However, the demand for more adaptable, cooperative, and iterative project management techniques arose as healthcare delivery grew more complex due to patient-centered care, regulatory changes, and technology breakthroughs. Traditional models (pre-2000), transitional models (2000–2015), and emerging models (post-2015) are the three temporal domains into which the suggested conceptual framework divides healthcare project management. While transitional models added aspects of stakeholder participation, risk management, and evidence-based decision-making, traditional models placed more emphasis on control and predictability. Agile, Lean, Six Sigma, and hybrid frameworks are examples of emerging approaches that place an emphasis on value-based results, digital integration, responsiveness, and continuous improvement. These new methods are particularly useful for managing the adoption of electronic health records (EHRs), telehealth initiatives, AI integration, pandemic response initiatives, and the creation of healthcare infrastructure. Additionally, the framework emphasizes key success elements for each model, such as data governance, regulatory compliance, interprofessional collaboration, leadership engagement, and flexibility. It also tackles issues including resource limitations, clinical and administrative priorities not aligning, and reluctance to change. In both developed and developing environments, this conceptual framework provides a basis for planning, carrying out, and assessing healthcare programs by combining insights from previous approaches and assessing the effectiveness of contemporary methods. It emphasizes how crucial it is to use context-sensitive methods and strategically match project objectives with organizational missions and patient needs. In the end, the framework offers academics, professionals, and decision-makers a methodical perspective for comprehending the development of healthcare project management and for encouraging creativity in upcoming healthcare delivery systems.",

    "summary": "Urban planning is an important aspect of land management due to the rapid growth in built-up structures, better known as urbanization. Accordingly, urbanization change detection with remote sensing technology has been a hot spot for research in recent times. In the present work, a method for detecting changes using Sentinel-2 optical data is proposed over a large area of Prayagraj City, Uttar Pradesh, India. A hybrid prediction model involving a support vector machine (SVM) and cellular automata-Markov (CA Markov) model is proposed to find the changes in the earth’s features, viz., built-up, vegetation, water bodies, and barren land, followed by prediction of urban growth. In the classification, the mixing of two earth surface features, i.e., built-up and bare soil is observed. To avoid this mixing, the spectral responses of different bands of Sentinel-2 are analyzed, and after a rigorous analysis, it is observed that bands 3, 4, 11, and 12 are suitable for the study of urban feature extraction. The baseline years for change detection are chosen as 2015 and 2020, and the transition probability matrix (TPM) is computed using classified images of 2015 and 2024. Based on TPM, the Land Use Land Cover (LULC) for the year 2030 is predicted using the Markov model, which is spatially mapped with CA. It is predicted that built-up cover will continue to increase while vegetation and barren land decrease during 2024 and 2030. This study will help to make a plan to control unplanned development and assist the vision of smart city development.",

    "summary": "The purpose of this study is to analyse the current state of the economy and public finances in Ukraine and to develop an inclusive and collaborative framework for their post-war recovery. The main research methods used were quantitative, qualitative and documentary analysis. Quantitative analysis was used to evaluate and compare key economic and financial indicators between different countries, as well as to identify trends, including inclusive ones, in the development of the economy and public finances. Qualitative analysis was used to study and analyse the political, social and economic factors that influence the development of an inclusive economy and public finance after conflicts. The documentary analysis was used to assess the legal and regulatory framework governing economic and financial relations in Ukraine and other countries, and to determine the capacity of the existing regulatory system to ensure inclusive post-war recovery. The results of the study, based on the study of empirical material and typologies of best practices of countries that have been in various types of conflicts, prove the need for an in-depth study of the interactions and interdependencies between the inclusive economy and public finance based on the Inclusive Growth Index and structural changes in the issues of the impact of inclusion on the ontogeny of public finance, solving problems with corruption, involvement of civil society institutions and adaptation of SMEs to the conditions of the military economy. The paper also identifies structural, fiscal and debt obstacles to ensuring the sustainability of public finances, which threatens Ukraine's further post-war recovery based on an inclusive paradigm. The authors present the key determinants of post-war recovery based on an inclusive country ranking, which should underpin further progress in public finance in the context of short-, medium- and long-term post-war goals. The study's conclusions are based on the inclusive economy paradigm, which forms an ecosystem of rationalisation of natural resources and the use of innovations, which should become the basis for post-war recovery, ensuring sustainable and balanced development of public finances and inclusive economic policy based on the Ukrainian Peace Formula. To this end, the article substantiates the need to develop a modified version of the strategy (in the tactical projection – more broadly adapted to the conditions of the wartime economy, the need to provide financial resources for the shift in economic policy from raw material orientation to inclusive development, in the medium term – anti-crisis correction of behavioural models of economic agents in the direction of imbuing the Ukraine Facility Plan for 2024-2027 with the spirit of inclusion and barrier-free access, and in the long term – achieving the goals of post-war recovery, ensuring the sustainability of public finances and the national economy) for reforming the public finance management system, which should organically include the post-war recovery of Ukraine and take into account the inclusiveness of the economy, taking into account the programmed joint evolutionary progress in the specified niche (sectoral) strategies. The new socio-economic, financial and budgetary reality coloured by the Russian-Ukrainian war makes it necessary to rethink the interactions and interdependencies between inclusion, public finance and the potential for post-war recovery, both as a result of their collaboration and multidirectional development. The unregulated transition of economic policy to inclusive development is the root cause of the current restraint of transformational changes in public finance, and further creates a regulatory \"vacuum\" in the unbalanced development of niche strategies that define the paradigm of inclusion and sustainability of public finance. In such a disposition, there is no logical institutional and regulatory \"flow\" between these strategies to the conceptualisation of Ukraine's post-war recovery from the consequences of the war, as expressed in the Ukraine Facility Plan for 2024-2027.",

    "summary": "   The Philippines’ transition toward an aging population calls for various agencies to address the evolving and diverse needs of older people. Notably, the Filipino subscription to filial piety, which emphasizes respect and caring for older people, encourages families and communities to promote the welfare of our senior citizens. However, a recent article noted that Filipinos’ caring behaviors toward their older family members might be slowly fading, as evidenced by increasing cases of family abandonment/abuse and emerging negative perceptions about aging. Hence, it is imperative for the government to support older people across settings where they continue to live and function. \n   The National Commission of Senior Citizens (NCSC), created in 2019, serves as the lead agency for promoting the welfare and protection of Filipino older adults. Meanwhile, various policies for senior citizens commonly involve socioeconomic provisions, such as social pension, retirement benefits, mandatory insurance coverage (PhilHealth), and discount/tax incentives on several purchases or services. Other relevant programs are also reported, including protection from abuse and neglect, promotion of health and wellness, reinforcement of roles in nation-building, navigation of health and social services, and coordination of various agency services for older people. Nonetheless, there is limited data on the implementation and evaluation of these programs on the ground. A multisectoral approach, ensuring that all stakeholders’ voices are heard and appropriate resources are pooled, is crucial to foster healthy aging. \n   It is imperative to empower communities to integrate various factors that influence the well-being of older people. Thus, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates the development of age-friendly environments (AFEs) to reinforce the physical and mental capacities, including other health-related attributes of older people throughout their life course. There are eight interconnected domains to promote AFEs: community and healthcare, communication and information, social participation, respect and social inclusion, civic participation and employment, housing, outdoor buildings and spaces, and transportation. This indicates that supporting older people requires systems thinking, which includes identifying and managing individual needs, existing community resources, and environmental factors that impact their overall functioning. \n   It should be noted that each domain is instrumental in an age-friendly environment. For instance, adequate spaces and facilities could provide venues for health promotion, social interaction, and training for older people and their families. Transportation modes that consider the needs of people with disabilities could contribute to social inclusion and access to health and social services. Residential facilities could assist persons who are abandoned/homeless and those who require longterm care. Meanwhile, resources to enhance the digital literacy of older people for communication and information could also promote civic engagement, healthcare access, and social participation. Through a whole-society approach, AFEs could foster aging in place, wherein older people can live safely and independently in their households and communities. \n   Six elements are required to develop a national framework for age-friendly communities: (1) partnerships, networking, and stakeholders; (2) leadership and strategic thinking; (3) human, financial, institutional, and cultural resources; (4) capacitybuilding; (5) knowledge, research, and innovation; and (6) monitoring and evaluation. Last year, the NCSC has started designing a framework for age-friendly environments in the Philippines. Developing an AFE national program could take months to years, as consultations with various partners, mapping and optimizing resources, and developing training and evaluation programs involve iterative and continuous processes. The Philippines can also learn from other countries on how to plan for and sustain age-friendly communities. However, AFE model cases are mostly from high-income countries like the US, the UK, Spain, and Japan, of which have different contexts from the Philippines. Therefore, developing age-friendly environments in the country should consider the unique contexts where older people live. Various agencies (local, national, international; public and private) in health, social care, labor, transport, housing, education, and media should be tapped for comprehensive organizational support. Representations from older people, families, caregivers, people with disabilities, and other interest groups are also important for inclusive stakeholder consultations. \n   The role of academic institutions in developing age-friendly communities cannot be overemphasized, as research could enable understanding of local contexts, creation of evidence-based policies, and guidance to policy implementation/evaluation through scientific and ethical processes. Hence, educational institutions should explore collaborative partnerships with their local communities to facilitate co-production of knowledge that can be utilized in developing AFEs. Enabling the new generation of researchers to work with older people and other stakeholders, could also provide opportunities to combat ageism and develop advocacies for marginalized populations. As suggested by Felipe-Dimog et al., schools are conducive venues to leverage the Filipino value of family orientation and respect toward older people. Apart from being research and innovation hubs, educational institutions should serve as centers for values formation toward age-friendliness. \n   Direction from the national government is paramount to developing and supporting age-friendly communities in the Philippines. As previously described, leadership and strategic thinking in AFEs is needed to ensure that the right stakeholders are included, sufficient resources are availed, appropriate capacity-building activities are provided, relevant research projects are conducted, and pragmatic evaluation methods are utilized. The NCSC, as the primary agency tasked to foster age-friendly communities in the country, should ensure the above processes are fulfilled in the best way possible. Financial support is also crucial for maintaining partnerships, hiring additional staff, building spaces, and creating other facilities to make agefriendly communities a reality. As devolution continues, the government should aid low-resource settings to design and sustain age-friendly environments. Recognizing that the country is nearing the aging population, supporting senior citizens should go beyond giving discounts or free services. Ultimately, a strong political will is the key to ensure that all older people are cared for and provided with resources to successfully age in their communities.",

    "summary": "\n The U.S. Department of Energy Spent Fuel and Waste Science and Technology (SFWST) program is planning to conduct a series of full-scale shake table tests to simulate hypothetical earthquake conditions and record the response of surrogate spent nuclear fuel (SNF) assemblies in a dry canister storage system mockup. The shake table motions will represent a range of hypothetical earthquake conditions at hypothetical locations in the continental U.S. to generally define the range of mechanical loads that SNF can be expected to experience during extended dry storage periods. This paper describes the pretest predictions made with LS-DYNA models of the mockup storage systems.\n The test will use two dry storage system configurations, a mockup vertical concrete cask (VCC) and a mockup horizontal storage module (HSM). The test will use a production-quality canister and basket. Within the canister will be four instrumented fuel assemblies with fuel rods containing surrogate mass and 28 instrumented dummy assemblies that are intended to match the mass and outer dimension of a fuel assembly. The finite element models include models of the VCC and HSM on the shake table to calculate the system level dynamic responses and separate single fuel assembly models to calculate stress and strain in fuel assembly components. Both types of models include nonlinear behavior like rod-to-rod contact and the ability for VCC’s to rock and slide.\n This paper presents the expected response of the VCC, HSM, and fuel assemblies to the shake table testing that is planned to start in April of 2024. The earthquake conditions represent seismic hazards in the 2,000-to-20,000-year return period range. The test data is expected to confirm the expectation based on the presented analyses that fuel rod cladding will remain intact, fuel assembly structural components like guide tubes will remain intact, and no significant VCC sliding or tipping will occur in the range of conditions to be tested with the shake table.",

Methodology: The study used a survey questionnaire. The researcher focused on the students’ perceptions of the blended learning components, blended learning models, and student engagement. Results: According to the findings, using the blended learning model focusing on the rotation model is effective in science academic performance. It is approved by rejecting the null hypothesis about the significant differences between the pretest and post-test. Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between the blended learning components and science learning outcomes. Conclusion: There is no significant relationship between the science learning outcomes and the blended learning models implemented at JONHS. The school administration may consider improving the curriculum by implementing blended learning models as part of learning in the science curriculum. Further studies on the different blended learning models in teaching science were also recommended. Aside from additional studies, crafting of an intervention program may be utilized for different blended learning models. Broadening the scope of research on the influence of blended learning in other subjects or increasing the sample size can all be considered.",

    "summary": "In Nepal, the integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) into mathematics teaching and learning has become a topic of growing interest and importance in the field of mathematics education. Nevertheless, the effective and efficient integration of technology into the classroom environment remains a significant challenge for mathematics teachers. Therefore, this study examines the technological challenges faced by mathematics teachers and the key factors that have the greatest impact on integrating ICT into teaching and learning activities in mathematics classrooms. An online survey design was used in the quantitative research. A structural online survey questionnaire was distributed through Viber, WhatsApp, and Messenger to 135 public and 150 private secondary-level mathematics teachers in Kathmandu Metropolitan City during the academic year 2023–2024. The overall response from mathematics teachers was only 197 (59.23%). The response data was downloaded into Excel and cleaned. Means, standard deviations, and multiple linear regression were used to analyze the cleaned data using the JAMOVI software. The data clearly show that there are no challenges in the use of ICT, professional development, and pedagogical issues. However, technological limitations present challenges from teachers’ perspectives. Additionally, technological limitations, professional development, and pedagogical issues have significant correlations and positive impacts on the use of ICT, with pedagogical issues emerging as the most influential factor. This means that teachers are qualified to integrate ICT into their teaching and learning activities. However, there were technological limitations in mathematics classrooms. Therefore, inadequate access to hardware, lack of technical support, and unreliable Internet connectivity are necessary for mathematics teachers to effectively incorporate ICT into their teaching and learning activities. Furthermore, further research should use a larger sample size to validate these results in diverse educational contexts in Nepal.",

    "summary": "The article on the study of college students' sports general course teaching actual effect in the process, the advanced idea of the specialization of physical education reform at home and abroad, the corresponding reference and efficient new as a specific research object, mainly in the form of class experimental teaching and questionnaire survey, summed up the final conclusion, namely the sports teaching in colleges and universities need to combine with specialized elements. The general sports courses mainly is the development direction of the teaching content more rich diversity, and the teaching method and means more human, have fun, to sports performance evaluation method is more scientific. Special teaching can make the teaching content of the professional degree and the depth of the study are improved effectively, and special sports general class practice content not only can better improve the body quality of contemporary college students themselves, with its novel selectivity of diverse teaching methods, and can effectively improve the students' interests in learning. At the same time, fitness testing could also help students to establish their individual sports quality files, and then drive to achieve the goal of health education of college students. The research background of sports general specialized teaching In the process of rapid social and economic development in our country, but people's own physical quality drops, and in colleges and universities, the sub-health population scale expanding gradually. It can be found in the physical test results of recent years, juvenile physical decline year by year, and after the youth to enter colleges and universities, the problem is widespread in the colleges and universities. With the expansion of the scale of higher education, students sports foundation polarized increasingly serious, the differences between individual is different, this also gradually become the universities sports teaching focus on the problem. At present, most of the colleges and universities sports teaching time is two years, and the main teaching content is badminton, basketball, volleyball and so on regular exercise. Sports theoretical teaching content is health care and sports exercise method and its function and value, etc. The physical education curriculum Settings have been unable to meet the requirements of the present personnel training, and teaching form is single and boring, and relatively stringent, obsolete teaching content and also too much emphasis on teachers' leading role, make the students principal role cannot be get play, eventually led to the decrease of the student's study enthusiasm, it is difficult to achieve the goal of the new personnel training . To cultivate professional talent, we must rely on the basis of sports teaching, the university's basic course is the general sports courses. However, in recent years, colleges and universities sports general lessons for pay more attention to teaching, and then played down the professional, for engineering college students pay more attention to the cultivation of the humanities, and the concept of general education and the combination of school curriculum and teaching reform, through sports, general education of university undergraduate course education to carry on the design. Although the general course and specialized recess contradiction, but the reform of the specialization of the male body is mainly to improve the students' physique as the foundation, the ultimate goal is to strengthen students' basic quality by using the method of specialization, make its interest in physical exercise, and through the specialized teaching methods to achieve the goal of improving students'. And one year in the university sports general course teaching is to better International Conference on Management Science, Education Technology, Arts, Social Science and Economics (MSETASSE 2015) © 2015. The authors Published by Atlantis Press 443 implement the specialized teaching. We have certain challenging due to the reform of the public sports professional, so, need more from the reality of school, in the actual teaching of sports actively looking for college sports organic combination between general education and specialized teaching pattern. The research object and methods The research object Research object selection college freshman, and carries on the general sports courses teaching and special course experience. The research methods Questionnaire survey Undergraduates as a key research object, on the special experience of teaching content and general course teaching. Undergraduate new students of the first semester will take the form of sports general course teaching, and for the teaching contents, means and the effect of the classroom, etc. to design the content of the questionnaire. This questionnaire survey is based on random sampling survey method, selecting 1000 undergraduates, and in the process of sampling, completely according to the probability sampling method, including men and women in the selected samples, due to the content of the investigation is the general, therefore, need not consider gender distinction. Classroom experiment method Implemented in the process of classroom teaching and students' interaction, and we will advise to students in the process of learning experience and opinions for consultation. In addition, outside the classroom, can let the students fill in the questionnaire, and write the related study summary report, through different ways to experiment on the effects of physical education teaching and improve . The analysis of the results of the study Sports general course satisfaction survey analysis Because of undergraduate sports general class content is extensive, so choose ten aspects of survey content, to study college students for the general sports courses evaluation and understanding. Rating is divided into five categories, namely, satisfied, satisfied, general, not satisfied with, and are not satisfied, while scores as 5 points, 4 points, three points, 2 points, 1 point. The average scores of all subjects in a project called \"satisfaction\", so the three points belongs to the neutral evaluation, and do not meet the three part is defined as a negative attitude, above three points is defined as a positive attitude, as a result, the higher the score, the higher the degree of satisfaction. In the actual survey results, it can be summarized in the following two points: first, from the overall perspective, the students of physical education curriculum setting is approved, and from ten aspects of the content of the investigation results, only one evaluation hasn't been attained three points. Second, analyze the satisfaction of the rankings can be found, ranking in the front is a directional cross-country and swimming teaching, and the last is the sports teaching theory, the main reason is the single theory class teaching content boring, and the experience of specialized course arrangement is also very single, unable to meet the demand of students' interest in their own. The morning exercises arrangement is satisfaction ranked the second project, this morning exercises exercise in the form of always is not accepted by students. The analysis of the university freshmen teaching experiment result Based on the actual investigation and study, it found that the highest satisfaction is sports teaching content and density. In the actual classroom teaching, the sports classroom teaching in the 90th minute, the density of its movement is only 20 minutes of running, and the rest of the time is for sports theory of knowledge interpretation and analysis. For sports general class of classroom teaching methods, students are not approved, so the satisfaction in the ranking. In the actual classroom teaching of sports, the general teaching of directional cross-country, PE teachers by the",

This study used a researcher-made survey questionnaire. The respondents were the public elementary school teachers in Maramag 1 District. This study utilized Purposive Sampling as a sampling procedure. The data were treated with descriptive statistics such as frequency count, percentage, mean, standard deviation, and Pearson r. The National Learning Camp in Maramag 1 District, Division of Bukidnon, School Year 2024-2025, was Very Highly Practiced in terms of Identifying Campers, Parents' Consent, Attendance, School Provisions Strategies, Monitoring and Evaluation, Collaborative Expertise, and Stakeholder Support. Before the NLC was conducted, most learners were at the Instructional level, indicating that most learners required some guidance or support to read effectively but were not fully independent. However, the learners' reading levels after the National Learning Camp (NLC) 2024 demonstrated a significant improvement in reading proficiency. Most learners progressed to the instructional reading level, meaning they could read with some guidance or support, indicating that the NLC positively impacted their reading abilities. The results show that the NLC positively and significantly impacted learners' reading levels. Therefore, the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between the reading level of the NLC learners before and after the NLC 2024 was conducted is rejected. Educators may concentrate on efficient camper identification, obtaining parental Consent, overseeing attendance, executing school provision strategies, and conducting thorough monitoring and Evaluation. School heads could contemplate implementing focused literacy initiatives, such as the National Learning Camp (NLC), to improve children's reading skills. Students may acknowledge the significant advancement in reading skills following the NLC, reflecting the program's beneficial effects.",

    "summary": "Quality assurance has been a priority in higher education universities in Mongolia for over two decades. Since 2016, the Mongolian University of Science and Technology (MUST) has implemented the international quality management system ISO 9001:2015. The management systems for educational organizations ISO 21001:2018 have been in operation to meet the criteria for standards for six years. In connection with the implementation of international quality assurance, there was a need to assess the learning outcomes of English for Specific Purposes at MUST by standards. This paper aims to present the results of course learning outcomes assessment of the English for Specific Purposes included in the bachelor’s degree programs for engineering students offered by the School of Foreign Languages. The authors have applied an assessment sample developed by the Department of Academic Affairs and Digital Transformation, MUST, in their study. The paper describes an overview of the assessment process implemented from the 2023-2024 academic year. Quantitative and qualitative methods were applied in this study. The satisfaction survey on the course was conducted using Google Forms. The SPSS program was a systematic method for measuring CLO results. As for ESP, five learning outcomes were developed and evaluated using the same criteria. The study revealed that 63.41% of the participants met the CLO requirements and 36.59% failed. The practicality of this article is to get some insight into how to improve course learning outcomes of the ESP based on this assessment. Finally, the study attracts university colleagues striving to evaluate learning outcomes and whose professions will be accredited by domestic or overseas accreditation councils.",

    "summary": "This study investigated the effectiveness of classroom management strategies and their relationship to learners' performance in Good Manners and Right Conduct (GMRC) among Grade VI students in Don Carlos I District, Bukidnon, for the 2024–2025 school year. The study aimed to determine the level of effectiveness of specific classroom management strategies—Positive Reinforcement Techniques, Classroom Rules and Expectations, Social-Emotional Learning (SEL) Programs, Conflict Resolution Strategies, and Parental Involvement in Character Development—and how these strategies influence learners' performance in GMRC. A descriptive-correlational research design was employed, utilizing a researcher-made and validated survey questionnaire. A total of 100 Grade VI learners were selected using random sampling. Descriptive statistics, such as mean, standard deviation, and percentage, were used to interpret the level of effectiveness and learners' performance. Meanwhile, Pearson's r Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient was used to test the relationships between variables. Findings revealed that all classroom management strategies were rated as \"Very Highly Effective\" by the respondents. Learners' performance in GMRC was generally rated as \"Outstanding.\" Furthermore, statistical analysis showed significant positive correlations between the effectiveness of classroom management strategies and learners' academic performance in GMRC, with teacher praise, clear classroom expectations, SEL implementation, and parental involvement playing the most significant roles. Anchored on Bandura's Social Learning Theory, this study underscores the importance of a structured, supportive classroom environment in nurturing values-based education. It offers practical implications for educators and policymakers in strengthening character development through effective classroom management and stakeholder collaboration.",

    "summary": "Effective classroom management is crucial in technical education, particularly in disciplines like Architectural Drafting Technology (ADT), where discipline and practicality play significant roles in student learning. This study assessed specific classroom management practices relative to student performance and participation in the 2024-2025 Bachelor of Science in Industrial Technology program, majoring in ADT. A survey design was selected, and purposive sampling was chosen to choose respondents from varied year levels. The quantitative analysis consisted of descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients via Pearson, and linear regression to determine relationships between the management practices illustrated under the study and the academic variables. The study clarified how active supervision, policies, technology, and positive reinforcement positively affect students’ performance, attendance, and behavior. More explicitly, engaging and systematic tasks of limited conceptual density are conducive to learning gains, while interchange and the reduction of off-task behavior are promoted by employing technological supports. These findings indicate that adequate classroom management, proactively organized and preventive-descriptive, should be considered and applied correctly in technical education contexts. Teachers are encouraged to prepare to integrate these strategies in their classrooms effectively; the study suggests further research to establish its long-term result on skills acquisition and achievements.",

    "summary": "Effective classroom management significantly impacts student learning by creating a secure and structured environment with well-defined rules, ultimately enhancing student focus and academic success. This research investigated the relationship between classroom management practices and the learning environment within the Division of Misamis Oriental during the school year 2023-2024. The study employed a descriptive correlational design, surveying one hundred fifty-four (154) teachers and three hundred eight (308) students from Grades 4 to 6 across the Opol, Alubijid, and Laguindingan Districts, selected via stratified random sampling. Questionnaires, adapted from prior research and validated, were used to gather data. Analysis involved calculating descriptive statistics and employing Pearson's r and t-tests for inferential analysis. The findings indicated that teachers perceived their classroom management practices, particularly clear and engaging instruction, as being implemented 'at all times,' signifying a very positive assessment. Similarly, learners described their learning environment as being highly practiced 'at all times.' Importantly, the statistical analysis revealed a significant positive correlation between classroom management practices and the learners' learning environment. This underscores the critical role of clear expectations, a positive and practical learning atmosphere, consistent rules, positive reinforcement, and engaging instruction in fostering an effective learning environment. The study recommends that school administrators and teachers prioritize establishing consistent classroom rules, clearly communicating consequences, and designing classroom layouts conducive to learning. Furthermore, teachers should maintain well-resourced, visually appealing, comfortable, inclusive, and organized classroom spaces to optimize the learning experience for students.",

    "summary": "The efficient use of technology in the classroom significantly impacts the learners’ reading performance, underscoring its crucial role in enhancing learning outcomes and student achievement. This study was conducted to determine teachers’ practices on technology integration and learners’ reading performance in Misamis Oriental during the School Year 2023-2024. It specifically sought to describe the respondents’ characteristics, find the level of the respondents’ practices on the integration of technology, examine the level of learners’ reading performance based on Phil-IRI results, test the significant difference in the respondents’ practices on the integration of ICT when grouped according to their characteristics, and determine the significant relationship between the respondents practices on the integration of technology and learners reading performance. The study involved one hundred fifty (150) teachers in Grades 4 to 6 in Misamis Oriental, selected using Slovin’s formula and stratified random sampling. A survey questionnaire was modified from Kimmons’s (2020) study, which was subsequently analyzed to determine the data’s central tendency and distribution using descriptive statistics such as mean and standard deviation. The study used Pearson Correlation (r) and other correlation techniques to examine the variables’ correlations. In addition, a t-test was employed to compare groups and see whether any statistically significant differences existed. Findings reveal that the respondents’ practices on integrating technology are very well practiced, and the learners’ reading performance is very satisfactory based on the PHIL-IRI Post-test result. However, no significant relationship exists between the respondents’ practices of integrating technology and learners’ reading performance except for proof and facilities. Further, there is a significant difference in the respondents’ practices when grouped according to their characteristics, except for training/seminars on integrating technology. Additionally, the presence and quality of technical proof and facilities are significantly related to the learners’ reading performance and have a stronger association after intervention. This concludes that well-practiced technology integration leads to satisfactory reading performance and improved academic outcomes. The school head should conduct regular assessments to ensure new gadgets are compatible with the existing IT infrastructure",

    "summary": "Abstract The study aims to reveal the Romanian employees and entrepreneurs’ development preferences in their current work environment, for both professional and personal skills, in terms of content and delivery method. Based on lack of relevant quantitative analysis for the outcome expected, a study was performed using an online survey, conducted in October 2024, collecting a total of 918 valid responses. The study sample consisted in individuals aged 19-55, currently employed in Romania, with at least one year of work experience. The results show that respondents benefited occasionally from development solutions, the frequency being associated with the current occupation, favorable for office roles and managerial position, rather than physical roles. An additional positive association is made with a higher level of completed studies, personal income and size of the company they work for. Classroom training remains popular, and AI-based is preferred by younger generations, while a third of the respondents use only one development option. The residentials of larger cities and middle to top managers prefer collaborative tools and learning journeys, and Gen Z prefers learning by observation, contrary to more senior employees. No association was found either between frequency and gender, residential environment, generation, or career stage, nor between type of professional development solution and gender. The study contributes to a better understanding of development solutions and their frequency usage, and the demographic and occupational factors association, for better upskilling and re-skilling programs, and thus a more efficient use of training time and budgets in an exponential changing environment.",

    "summary": "This study employed a descriptive research method to investigate the study habits of grade six learners in Patikul East District, Division of Sulu, during the 2024-2025 school year. A purposive sampling technique was utilized, selecting 100 participants from four elementary schools, ensuring representation of both genders. Data collection involved a survey questionnaire adapted from Pelayo (2015), which assessed demographic information and study habits across four key variables: Time Management, Home Environment, School Environment, and Personal Factors. The analysis revealed that most participants were aged 11 to 12, with a significant portion of parents having elementary-level education and low monthly incomes. All respondents acknowledged the influence of time management, home, and school environments on their study habits. However, no significant differences were found in study habits based on gender, age, parental education, or income. Notably, a strong positive correlation was identified between time management and home environment, as well as a moderate correlation with school environment. The findings suggest that supportive environments are crucial for fostering effective study habits, ultimately enhancing academic performance. Recommendations include the establishment of dedicated study spaces, flexible study schedules, and encouragement of collaborative learning among peers. Future research should examine additional factors that may impact study habits among learners.",

    "summary": " \nRecursive Self-Improvement (RSI)\nIn the next issue we will publish more articles on RSI, for instance, using reinforcement learning (RL). These articles, along with, in this issue, Darwin Gödel Machine and DarwinLM, show that RSI will come in different flavors, e.g. here using evolutionary search, and have different purposes. So far, no one RSI technique itself triggers dramatic progress toward AGI.\nAgentic AI vs. AI Agents\nThe goal of Agentic AI — to render AI scalable and adaptable in complex environments — seems inherently so much more powerful than individual AI agents that the focus on progress toward artificial general intelligence should be on Agentic AI progress against benchmarks.\nClearly, the most advanced Agentic AI should be deployed to advance safety and value alignment, as Kumarage and colleagues show in this issue.\nDevelopment of Agentic AI indicates a need to focus on the type of AGI ecology that will emerge (e.g. multipolar scenarios rather than singletons), and permits using the paradigm of game theory to control safety and value alignment, as I wrote in 2019.[1] I have more to say on this subject.\nTimeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+\nSenior Editor-at-Large Gil Syswerda has constructed a provocative Timeline to Artificial General Intelligence 2025 – 2030+. He gives key AI advances, economic, social, and geopolitical effects of AI. As early as 2028-2029, AI could replace the majority of human economic activity, potentially disrupting society due to widespread change happening so rapidly. But he is optimistic:\nBy the end of the decade, superintelligence is present on Earth. Human institutions are no longer in control. Everything changes in ways beyond current understanding....Humanity survives the transition—and enters an Age of Abundance. The meaning of citizenship, nationhood, and law undergoes foundational redefinition.\nArticles\nComparing Apples to Oranges: A Taxonomy for Navigating the Global Landscape of AI Regulation\nThe EU has a unified framework for regulating AI, China has its own governance structure, which it has efficiently imposed throughout China due to centralized control. Since the proposed 10-year moratorium on state AI regulation was killed in the ‘Big Beautiful Bill,’ the US now seems headed toward a uncoordinated patchwork of regulation at the state and federal level. Thus, this work by Alanoca et al. is critically important and urgent. From the abstract:\nClarifying the scope and substance of AI regulation is vital to uphold democratic rights and align international AI efforts. We present a taxonomy to map the global landscape of AI regulation. Our framework targets essential metrics—technology or application-focused rules, horizontal or sectoral regulatory coverage, ex ante or ex post interventions, maturity of the digital legal landscape, enforcement mechanisms, and level of stakeholder participation—to classify the breadth and depth of AI regulation.\nAs our co-founding editor, Steve Omohundro foresaw in 2014, AI itself will play an increasing role in evolving the legacy human legal regime in general and regulations governing AI in particular:\nThe legal codes of many countries have become quite complex. Several AI projects are trying to create formal digital versions of legal codes (CodeX, 2014). These systems will eventually be used to resolve legal issues and perhaps even act as arbitrators or judges. Sophisticated AI systems with knowledge of the legal system will be used to help craft and simplify new legislation. [2]\nAccordingly, humans should initiate the process of AI taking over evolution of law, notably in the area of AI safety, with human oversight. In principle, LLMs can absorb the entire global body of human law and compare the different regimes to provide a cohesive unified over-arching structure, which no human is capable of doing. As AI progresses toward AGI, it can evolve the Alanoca et al. taxonomy to organize the diverse and inchoate international, national, and local regulatory regimes following the examples the authors provide.\nReal-World Gaps in AI Governance Research\nStrauss et al. did a massive survey of 1,178 safety and reliability papers analyzed from 9,439 generative AI papers between Jan 2020 and Mar 2025. They found significant gaps in AI governance research, particularly in post-deployment contexts and high-risk areas. ​\n\nCorporate AI research is increasingly influential, focusing on pre-deployment safety while neglecting real-world deployment issues. ​\nCorporate AI (Anthropic, Google DeepMind, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI) has more citations than leading academic institutions (academic institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, Stanford University, University of California Berkeley, and University of Washington) – see their Table 2.\nGoogle DeepMind has more citations than the top four academic institutions combined. ​\nCorporate AI research prioritizes model alignment and testing, with less focus on deployment-stage issues like bias.\nThere is a critical lack of research on the safety and reliability of AI systems in real-world applications.\n\nAI Agents vs. Agentic AI: A Conceptual Taxonomy, Applications and Challenges\nSapkota et al. delineate agent AI vs. agentic AI, briefly giving the history and the motivation behind agentic AI toward its prime goal of scalability and adaptability in complex environments. Thus, agentic AI is a key step in the evolution of AI to AGI and superintelligence. As for safety, trust-centric operations will prioritize safety mechanisms, ensuring verifiable output and ethical compliance.\n\nAI Agents are modular systems driven by LLMs and LIMs for task-specific automation. ​\nAgentic AI represents a paradigm shift with multi-agent collaboration, dynamic task decomposition, and coordinated autonomy.\nAI Agents are autonomous software entities designed for goal-directed task execution within bounded environments. ​\nKey characteristics include autonomy, task-specificity, and reactivity with adaptation.\nAgentic AI systems manage complex, multi-step tasks requiring coordination among multiple agents..\nGenerative AI systems are stateless and lack the ability to interact with their environment autonomously.\nLLMs exhibit reactive behavior, producing output only when prompted, without autonomous goal pursuit.\nThe evolution from generative models to AI Agents is driven by the integration of large-scale language models (LLMs) as reasoning engines.\nAI Agents utilize LLMs like GPT-3 and LLaMA to perform adaptive planning and real-time decision-making.\nAgents function as cognitive engines that interpret user goals and manage complex workflows.\nAgentic AI systems extend the capabilities of traditional AI Agents by enabling collaboration among multiple intelligent entities.\nThey allow for goal decomposition, where user objectives are parsed into manageable tasks distributed across agents. ​\nInter-agent communication is facilitated through asynchronous messaging and shared memory\n\nMeasuring AI Agent Autonomy: Towards a Scalable Approach with Code Inspection\nHow to define “artificial general intelligence”? It’s like trying to define “life”. Most agree autonomy has to be included in defining “human-level intelligence”. In the next issue we will give our view. Here Cihon et al. present an operational definition of “autonomy” based on the agent architecture (a better description than ‘code inspection’) and without having to observe agent behavior, per se, based on an eight-component taxonomy of autonomy  – see their Figure 1. For example, human-programmed goals = no autonomy, while agent-programmed goals = autonomy.\nAs the authors note and we stress, “the level of agent autonomy is crucial for understanding both their potential benefits and risks,” i.e. AGI safety.\nDarwin Gödel Machine: Open-Ended Evolution of Self-Improving Agents: Main Article & Appendix F on Safety\nIn the DGM, improvement in downstream tasks directly reflects an increase in self-improvement ability, enabling the potential for self-accelerating progress.\nHowever, these [various foundation model] approaches have yet to close the self-improvement loop, meaning improvements on downstream tasks do not translate into enhanced capabilities for self-modification or the acceleration of further innovations. We aim to mimic the acceleration of science and technology, where new tools and discoveries catalyze the creation of even more discoveries. Similarly, how can we emulate nature’s arc of evolution, which bends not only toward complexity but also an ever greater capacity to evolve [26, 41, 49]?\nThis article is notable for several reasons. First, recursive self-improvement is a strong signal of progress toward AGI/SI; the Darwin Gödel Machine (DGM) modifies its own code. Second, Schmidhüber’s provably self-improving Gödel Machine was theoretically bold but stalled on the self-proving piece. Zhang et al. use SOTA benchmarks (SWE-bench, Polyglot) to measure various improvements and therefore prove improvement operationally. They say their ‘empirical proofs’ weaken the Gödel Machine formal approach – but I disagree – the formal methods, for example, cannot prove true statements that their axioms don’t capture. Third, we hypothesize that progress toward AGI requires broadening the ML paradigm. Here Zhang et al. incorporate evolutionary programming to generate a population of coding agents and randomly sample them to find code improvements.\nThe most critical and important application of the most advanced AI is to apply to creating safety and value alignment.\nThus, the authors point out that self-improvement can be focused on the system’s safety (which I call recursive safety improvement) and describe the safety precautions they followed.\nDarwinLM: Evolutionary Structured Pruning of Large Language Models\nThis second article enabling AI recursive self-improvement (RSI) also uses evolutionary search, in this case to ",
