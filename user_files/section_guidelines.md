# Section Guidelines
## Abstract

150-250 words. Structure: (1) problem/gap, (2) approach, (3) key result with metrics, (4) main implication. 
Be specific. NO citations.


## Introduction

Open with the problem and its concrete impact.
Identify what's missing in current solutions using evidence.
State your contribution as specific, falsifiable claims.
End with brief paper roadmap.
Justify claims with evidence, don't just assert.


## Related Work

Group by approach/theme, not chronologically. For each cluster:
- What they did (method + reported results)
- Limitations relative to this work
- Direct comparison where applicable
Avoid generic praise. Be precise about differences. Cite liberally.


## Methods

Reproducibility is the goal. If possible and relevant, include:
- Architecture/algorithm with justification for key choices
- Hyperparameters, dataset details, compute resources
- Baseline comparisons (what and why)
- Evaluation metrics with rationale
Use present tense. Avoid implementation details unless critical.


## Results

Present experiment outcomes with relevant metrics or observations.
Compare results against expected improvements or baselines if available.
Never fabricate data or results.


## Discussion

Open by restating main finding in context of hypothesis.
Explain why it worked/failed using specific evidence and results. Acknowledge limitations honestly.
Compare to related work quantitatively where possible.
Speculation allowed but label it clearly.
End with concrete future directions, not vague "explore further.


## Conclusion

Summarize: what you did, what you found (with key metrics), broader implications (realistic, not grandiose), one actionable next step.
No new information. No citations.


## Acknowledgements

Format and polish the provided acknowledgements text into a professional academic style.
Keep the original meaning and intent, but ensure proper grammar, flow, and academic tone.
No citations needed. Keep it concise and appropriate for an academic paper.
