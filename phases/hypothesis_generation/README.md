# Hypothesis Generation Phase

Analyzes literature to identify findings and limitations to generate research hypotheses.

## Components

- **`PaperAnalyzer`**: Extracts key findings from papers
- **`LimitationAnalyzer`**: Identifies research limitations and opportunities
- **`HypothesisBuilder`**: Generates and validates research hypotheses

## Process

1. Extract findings from papers
2. Cluster and rank limitations
3. Generate hypotheses addressing limitations
4. Validate hypothesis compatibility

## Output

- `output/paper_findings.json` - Extracted findings
- `output/limitations.json` - Ranked limitations
- `output/hypotheses.json` - Generated hypotheses
