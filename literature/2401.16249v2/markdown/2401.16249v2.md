Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations play an important role in understanding and engineering heat transport
properties of complex materials. An essential requirement for reliably predicting heat transport properties is
the use of accurate and efficient interatomic potentials. Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have
shown great promise in providing the required accuracy for a broad range of materials. In this mini review
and tutorial, we delve into the fundamentals of heat transport, explore pertinent MD simulation methods,
and survey the applications of MLPs in MD simulations of heat transport. Furthermore, we provide a stepby-step tutorial on developing MLPs for highly efficient and predictive heat transport simulations, utilizing
the neuroevolution potentials (NEPs) as implemented in the GPUMD package. Our aim with this mini
review and tutorial is to empower researchers with valuable insights into cutting-edge methodologies that can
significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MD simulations for heat transport studies.



**I.** **INTRODUCTION**


Heat transport properties are crucial for numerous applications [1][,][2] . At the atomistic level, there
are primarily three computational methods for heat
transport [3] : molecular dynamics (MD) simulations,
methods related to Boltzmann transport equation
(BTE)–including, more generally, quasi-harmonic GreenKubo (QHGK) method [4] and Wigner transport equation
(WTE) approach [5][,][6] –combined with anharmonic lattice
dynamics (ALD) (BTE-ALD for short), and atomistic
Green function (AGF). Each method has its advantages

and disadvantages [3] . This mini review and tutorial focuses on the MD methods. For the BTE-ALD and
AGF approaches, we refer interested readers to previous tutorials [3][,][7][,][8] . Our emphasis is on thermal conductivity, including finite systems, instead of thermal boundary
conductance/resistance. For the latter, we suggest referring to a previous tutorial [9] and a review article [10] .


Notable advantages distinguish MD from the other two
methods. Firstly, MD can capture phonon-phonon scatterings at any order, while the other two methods are perturbative in nature and often consider only three-phonon
scatterings (for BTE-ALD) or even completely ignore the
anharmonicity (for AGF). Secondly, MD can naturally
capture scatterings of phonons by other sources such as
defects and mass disorder, extending its applicability to
fluid systems that are beyond the reach of the other two
methods. Thirdly, the computational cost of MD with

classical potentials is usually linear with respect to the
number of atoms, while it typically exhibits high-order
polynomial scaling in the other two methods. Based on
these considerations, MD proves particularly suitable for
studying heat transport in strongly anharmonic or highly
disordered systems.

Despite these advantages, MD simulations have grappled with challenges, particularly in terms of accuracy,
over a considerable period of time. The predictive power
of MD simulations is highly dependent on the accuracy of the classical potentials, which are mathematical
models representing the potential energy surface of systems in terms of geometric information. The interatomic
forces can be accurately computed using ab initio methods such as quantum-mechanical density-functional theory (DFT), leading to the _ab initio_ molecular dynamics
(AIMD) method, which has been applied to heat transport studies [11][–][14] . A challenge in the AIMD approach is
the high computational intensity, which imposes limitations on the size and timescales that can be effectively
simulated.

Recently, a type of classical potentials based on machine learning (ML) techniques, called machine-learned
potentials (MLPs), has emerged as an effective framework for constructing highly accurate interatomic potentials. Due to the flexible functional forms and a large
number of fitting parameters in MLPs, they can usually achieve significantly higher accuracy compared to
traditional empirical potentials. Notable MLP models,
to name a few, include Behler-Parrinello neural-network
potential (BPNNP) [15], Gaussian approximation potential (GAP) and related [16][–][18], spectral neighbor analysis
potential (SNAP) [19], moment tensor potential (MTP) [20],
deep potential (DP) [21], and atomic cluster expansion
(ACE) [22] . In this context, the recently developed neuroevolution potential (NEP) approach [23][–][25] simultaneously demonstrates excellent accuracy and outstanding
computational efficiency, offering a distinctive advantage.
Furthermore, MLPs have been increasingly used in MD
simulations, including heat transport simulations (see
Fig. 1 for a general trend).
Parallelization stands out as another key advancement
in MD simulations, involving the deployment of parallel computing to take advantage of rapid hardware upgrades and speedups, where a large number of processors
or cores work simultaneously to perform calculations,
to augment computational efficiency and spatiotemporal
scales of simulations. gpumd [26], short for Graphics Processing Units Molecular Dynamics, represents a noteworthy development in this arena. gpumd is a versatile MD
package fully implemented on graphics processing units
(GPUs). This advancement facilitates the simulations of
larger and more complex systems by leveraging the powerful parallel processing capabilities of GPUs. For example, it has been demonstrated that gpumd can achieve a
remarkable computational speed of 1 _._ 5 _×_ 10 [8] atom step/s
(equivalent to a cost of 6 _._ 7 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [9] s/atom/step) in MD
simulations using eight 80-gigabyte A100 graphics cards,



enabling simulations up to 100 million atoms for highentropy alloys employing a general-purpose unified NEP
machine-learned potential for 16 elemental metals and
their alloys [27] .
In this mini review and tutorial, we dig into the fundamentals of heat transport, the relevant MD simulation
methods, and the applications of MLPs in MD simulations of heat transport. We use the NEP model [23][–][25] as
implemented in the gpumd package [26] to illustrate the
various technical details involved. By completing this
tutorial, the readers will gain both fundamental knowledge and practical skills to construct MLPs and apply
them in highly efficient and predictive MD simulations
of heat transport.

_**1.**_ _**Thermal conductivity**_


Fourier’s law describes the empirical relationship governing heat transport, expressed as:


_∂T_

_Q_ _µ_ = _−_ � _κ_ _µν_ _∂x_ _ν_ _._ (1)

_ν_


Here _Q_ _µ_ is the heat flux in the _µ_ direction, _∂x∂T_ _ν_ [is the]
temperature gradient in the _ν_ direction, and _κ_ _µν_ is an
element of the second-rank conductivity tensor [28] . The
heat flux measures the heat transport per unit time and
per unit area, typically measured in W m _[−]_ [2] . The thermal



2




conductivity is commonly expressed in units of W m _[−]_ [1]

K _[−]_ [1] .

When the coordinate axes align with the principal axes
of the conductivity tensor, thermal transport decouples
in different directions, yielding a diagonal thermal conductivity tensor with three nonzero elements: _κ_ _xx_, _κ_ _yy_,
and _κ_ _zz_ . These are commonly denoted as _κ_ _x_, _κ_ _y_, and _κ_ _z_
for simplicity. For isotropic 3D systems, we usually define
a conductivity scalar _κ_ in terms of the trace of the tensor: _κ_ = ( _κ_ _x_ + _κ_ _y_ + _κ_ _z_ ) _/_ 3. For isotropic 2D systems, we
usually define a conductivity scalar for the planar components: _κ_ = ( _κ_ _x_ + _κ_ _y_ ) _/_ 2. For quasi-1D systems, it is
only meaningful to define the conductivity in a single direction. For simplicity, from here on we work with the
conductivity scalar _κ_ unless it is necessary to consider
the conductivity tensor.


_**2.**_ _**Thermal conductance**_


In macroscopic transport (the meaning of which will
become clear soon), thermal conductance _K_ is related to
thermal conductivity by:


_K_ = _κ_ _[A]_ (2)

_L_ _[,]_


where _A_ is the cross-sectional area and _L_ is the system
length along the transport direction. This relation is similar to that between electrical conductance and electrical
conductivity one learns in high school. Usually, thermal conductivity is considered an intrinsic property of a
material, and thermal conductance depends on the geometry ( _A_ and _L_ ). However, complexities emerge when
examining heat transport at the nanoscale or mesoscale.
At the nanoscale, the conventional concept of conductivity may lose its validity [29] . For example, thermal transport in materials with high thermal conductivity, such as
diamond at the nanoscale, is almost _ballistic_, meaning the
conductance changes little with increasing system length
_L_ . In this case, if we assume that Eq. (2) still holds, then
the thermal conductivity _κ_ cannot be regarded as a constant but as a function of the system length, _κ_ = _κ_ ( _L_ ).
This deviates from the conventional (macroscopic) concept of thermal conductivity.
Rather than adhering strictly to Eq. (2), one can generalize the relation between conductance and conductivity as follows:



apparent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) defined in Eq. (2)
approaches the diffusive conductivity _κ_ defined in Eq.
(3), as expected.
By comparing Eq. (2) and Eq. (3), we obtain the
following relation between the apparent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) and the diffusive thermal conductivity _κ_ :



1 _L_ [1]
_κ_ ( _L_ ) _A_ [=] _K_




[1] _L_ (4)

_κ_ _A_ _[.]_




[1] + [1]

_K_ 0 _κ_



From this, we have

_κ_ ( _L_ ) [=] _κ_



1 + _[κA]_
� _K_ 0 _L_



_._ (5)
�



It is more common to use thermal conductance per unit
area _G_, which is defined as


_G ≡_ _[K]_ (6)

_A_ _[.]_


The corresponding ballistic conductance per unit area is
_G_ 0 = _K_ 0 _/A_ . Using this, we have



_._ (7)
�



1 [1]
_κ_ ( _L_ ) [=] _κ_



1 + _[κ][/][G]_ [0]
� _L_



The ratio between the diffusive conductivity and the ballistic conductance per unit area defines a phonon mean
free path (MFP):


_λ ≡_ _[κ]_ _._ (8)

_G_ 0


In terms of the phonon MFP, we have



_._ (9)
�



1 [1]
_κ_ ( _L_ ) [=] _κ_



1 + _[λ]_
� _L_



This is known as the ballistic-to-diffusive transition formula for the length dependent thermal conductivity. Figure 2 schematically shows the ballistic-to-diffusive transition behavior.
The above discussion is simplified in the sense that no
channel dependence of the thermal transport has been
taken into account. Different channels usually have different MFPs and diffusive conductivities. In general,
both the conductivity and the MFP are frequency dependent and we can generalize Eq. (9) to

where _K_ 0 is the ballistic thermal conductance of the material. The term _κ_ in Eq. (3) refers to the _diffusive ther-_
_mal conductivity_, the conventional thermal conductivity
defined in the macroscopic limit ( _L →∞_ ) where the
phonon transport is diffusive. By contrast, the lengthdependent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) defined in Eq. (2)
is usually called the _apparent thermal conductivity_ or _ef-_
_fective thermal conductivity_ . In the diffusive limit, the

which is usually the volume of the simulation box, but
can also be specifically defined for low-dimensional systems simulated with vacuum layers. In MD simulations,
it is usually more convenient to work on the heat current
that is an extensive quantity:


_**J**_ _≡_ _V_ _**Q**_ (13)

conductance is _κ/λ_ = 1 GW m _[−]_ [2] K _[−]_ [1] . Then the apparent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) is given by Eq. (9), as
shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). In this case, 1 _/κ_ ( _L_ ) varies
linearly with 1 _/L_ . In the second model, we assume that
there are two phonon modes, one with a MFP of 0 _._ 1 _µ_ m,
and the other 1 _µ_ m, both having a diffusive conductivity
of 500 W m _[−]_ [1] K _[−]_ [1] . Then the ballistic conductances for
these two modes are 5 GW m _[−]_ [2] K _[−]_ [1] and 0.5 GW m _[−]_ [2]

K _[−]_ [1], respectively. The higher ballistic conductance in
the second toy model can be visualized in Fig. 2(c). Although the apparent thermal conductivity for each mode
follows Eq. (9), when combined, 1 _/κ_ ( _L_ ) does _not_ ex- _̸_
hibit linearity with 1 _/L_ . This is an important feature for
realistic materials with a general MFP spectrum _κ_ ( _ω_ ).

The expression above involves absolute positions and is
thus not directly applicable to periodic systems. To derive an expression that can be used for periodic systems,
we need to discuss potential energy and interatomic force
first.
For the MLPs discussed in this tutorial, the total potential energy _U_ of a system can be written as the sum
of site potentials _U_ _i_ :

interatomic potentials, including NEP. The current implementation of the heat current in lammps [32] is generally incorrect for many-body potentials, and corrections to lammps have only been done for special force
fields [33][,][34] . For any MLP that interfaces with lammps,
one must use the full 9 components of the per-atom
virial and provide a correct implementation of Eq. (24).
NEP has an interface for lammps that meets this requirement. To the best of our knowledge, among the
other publicly available MLP packages, only deepmd [21]

(after the work of Tisi _et al._ [35] ) and aenet [36] (after the
work of Shimamura _et al._ [37] ) have implemented the heat
current correctly. The heat current is also correctly
formulated [38] for a MLP based on the smooth overlap
of atomic positions [39] . Contrarily, the widely used MTP
method [20] (as implemented in Ref. 40), for example, exhibits an incorrect implementation of the heat current, as
demonstrated in Fig. 3. According to energy conservation, the accumulated heat from the atoms [cf. Eq. (25)]
should match that from the thermostats [cf. Eq. (31)],
allowing for only small fluctuations. It is evident that
both DP and NEP exhibit this property, whereas MTP
does not. Details on the calculations are provided in Appendix A.
Note that the above formulation of heat current has
been derived specifically for _local_ MLPs with atomcentered descriptors. For _semilocal_ message-passingbased MLPs, the formulation of heat current has been
shown by Langer _et al._ [41][,][42] to be more complicated.


**C.** **Overview of MD-based methods for heat**

**transport**


In the following, we review the heat transport MD
methods implemented in the gpumd package, including



_̸_


_̸_


where _C_ _µν_ ( _t_ ) is the heat current autocorrelation function
(HCACF)


_C_ _µν_ ( _t_ ) = _⟨J_ _µ_ (0) _J_ _ν_ ( _t_ ) _⟩_ e _._ (27)

The equations above define the running thermal conductivity, which is a function of the _correlation time t_ . In
MD simulations, the correlation function is defined as



profile [53] . This is to ensure that the contact resistance
is also included, and the total thermal conductance is
given by


_Q_
_G_ ( _L_ ) = (30)
_|_ ∆ _T_ _|_ _[.]_


The steady-state heat flux can be computed either microscopically or from the energy exchange rate _dE/dt_ in
the thermostatted regions and cross-sectional area _A_ as



_⟨J_ _µ_ (0) _J_ _ν_ ( _t_ ) _⟩_ e _≈_ _t_ [1] p



_t_ p

_J_ _µ_ ( _τ_ ) _J_ _ν_ ( _t_ + _τ_ ) _dτ._ (28)

� 0



where _t_ p is the _production time_ within which the heat
current data are sampled. This production run should
be in an equilibrium ensemble (as indicated by the subscript “e” in the HCACF expression), usually _NV E_, but
_NV T_ with a _global_ thermostat can also be used. Thermal
conductivity in the diffusive limit is obtained by taking
the limit of _t →∞_, but in practice, this limit can be
well approximated at an appropriate _t_ . One also needs
to ensure that the simulation cell is sufficiently large to
eliminate finite-size effects [47][–][49] .


_**2.**_ _**The NEMD method**_


The NEMD method is a nonequilibrum and inhomogeneous method that involves implementing a pair of
heat source and sink using a thermostatting method or
equivalent. There are two common relative positions of
the source and sink in the NEMD method, corresponding to two typical simulation setups. In one setup, the
source and sink are separated by half of the simulation
cell length _L_, and periodic boundary conditions are applied along the transport direction. Heat flows from the
source to the sink in two opposite directions in this periodic boundary setup. In the other setup, the source and
sink separated by _L_ are located at the two ends of the
system. Fixed boundary conditions are applied along the
transport direction to prevent sublimation of the atoms
in the heat source and sink. Heat flows from the source
to the sink in one direction in this fixed boundary setup.
It has been established [50] that the effective length in the
periodic boundary setup is only _L/_ 2. This factor must
be taken into account when comparing results from the
two setups.
When the system reaches a steady state, a temperature profile with a definite temperature gradient _∇T_ will
be established. Meanwhile, a steady heat flux _Q_ will
be generated. With these, one can obtain the apparent
thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) of a system of finite length _L_
according to Fourier’s law,


_Q_
_κ_ ( _L_ ) = (29)
_|∇T_ _|_ _[,]_


in the linear response regime where the temperature gradient _|∇T_ _|_ across the system is sufficiently small. It has
been observed that the local Langevin thermostat outperforms the global Nos´e-Hoover thermostat [51][,][52] in generating temperature gradients [53] . It has also been demonstrated that the temperature gradient should be directly
calculated from the temperature difference _|∇T_ _|_ = ∆ _T/L_
rather than through fitting part of the temperature




[1] _dE_

_A_ _dt_



_Q_ = [1]



(31)
_dt_ _[,]_



based on energy conservation. The two approaches must
generate the same result, and they have been used to
validate the implementation of heat flux in several MLPs,
as shown in Fig. 3.
A common practice in using the NEMD method is to
extrapolate to the limit of infinite length based on the results for a few finite lengths. It is important to note that
linear extrapolation is usually insufficient, as suggested
even by the toy-model results shown in Fig. 2(d).


_**3.**_ _**The HNEMD method**_


In the HNEMD method, an external force of the form [54]


_**F**_ _i_ [ext] = _E_ _i_ _**F**_ e + _**F**_ e _·_ **W** _i_ (32)


is added to each atom to drive the system out of equilibrium, inducing a nonequilibrum heat current (note the
subscript “ne”):




_·_ _**F**_ e _._ (33)
�



1
_⟨_ _**J**_ ( _t_ ) _⟩_ ne =
� _k_ B _T_



_t_

_dt_ _[′]_ _⟨_ _**J**_ (0) _⊗_ _**J**_ ( _t_ _[′]_ ) _⟩_ e

� 0



The driving force parameter _**F**_ e is of the dimension of
inverse length. The quantity in the parentheses is proportional to the running thermal conductivity tensor and
we have



_⟨J_ q _[µ]_ [(] _[t]_ [)] _[⟩]_ [ne]



_κ_ _[µν]_ ( _t_ ) _F_ e _[ν]_ _[.]_ (34)

_ν_




[ne]


=
_TV_ �



This provides a way of computing the thermal conductivity. In the HNEMD method, the system is in a homogeneous nonequilibrium state because there is no explicit heat source and sink. The system is periodic in the
transport direction and heat flows circularly under the
driving force. Because of the absence of heat source and
sink, no boundary scattering occurs for the phonons and
the HNEMD method is similar to the EMD method in
terms of finite-size effects.


_**4.**_ _**Spectral decomposition**_


In the framework of the NEMD and HNEMD methods,
one can also calculate spectrally decomposed thermal



6




conductivity (or conductance) using the virial-velocity
correlation function [54][,][55]



�



vasp, gpumd, quip, mlip, fitsnap, schnetpack, and
mlff respectively.
Most MLP packages are interfaced to lammps [32]

to perform MD simulations, while NEP is native to
gpumd [26] but can also be interfaced to lammps. The
MLFF method implemented in vasp is an on-the-fly
MLP that integrates seamlessly into AIMD simulations.
Table II compiles the publications up to today that
have used MD simulations driven by MLPs for thermal
transport studies. Note that our focus is on studies using MD simulations, excluding those solely based on the
BTE-ALD approach. The number of publications up to
March 10th, 2024 for each MLP is shown in Fig. 1.
The application of MLPs-based MD simulations to
thermal transport was pioneered by Sosso _et al._ in 2012
when they studied the thermal transport in the phasechanging amorphous GeTe system [64] . However, thermal
transport simulations are very computationally intensive,
and the rapid increase of the number of applications has
only been started after the development of the GPUbased DP [21] and NEP [23] models. In this regard, the NEP
model is particularly advantageous due to its superior
computational speed as compared to others [23][–][25] . With
comparable computational resources, it has been shown
to be as fast as or even faster than some empirical force
fields [154][,][156] .
There are numerous successful applications of MLPs
in thermal transport. In Fig. 4, we present results from
selected publications. The materials studied in these
works have reliable experimental results, serving as good
candidates for validating the applicability of MLPs. On
one hand, MLPs demonstrate good agreement with experimental results for highly disordered materials such
as liquid water [154], amorphous SiO 2 [142], and amorphous
silicon [152] . In addition to the reliability of MLPs, a crucial component for accurately describing the temperature
dependence of the thermal conductivity in liquids and
amorphous materials is a quantum correction method
based on the spectral thermal conductivity, as defined
in Eq. (39), and the quantum-statistical-correction factor, as given in Eq. (40). On the other hand, MLPs tend
to systematically underestimate the thermal conductivity of crystalline solids, including silicon (using a GAP
model) [74], CoSb 3 (using a MTP model), and graphite (inplane transport, using a NEP model) [141] . This underestimation has been attributed to the small but finite random force errors, and a correction has been devised [181] .
We will discuss this in more detail with an example in
the next section.


**IV.** **MOLECULAR DYNAMICS**

**SIMULATION OF HEAT TRANSPORT**

The virial-velocity correlation function here is essentially
the force-velocity correlation function defined for a (physical or imaginary) interface [56][,][57] .
The spectral quantities allow for a feasible quantumstatistical correction [3][,][58] for strongly disordered systems
where phonon-phonon scatterings are not dominant.
For example, the spectral thermal conductivity can be
quantum-corrected by multiplying the factor


_x_ [2] _e_ _[x]_

( _e_ _[x]_ _−_ 1) [2] _[,]_ (40)


where _x_ = ℏ _ω/k_ B _T_ .
There are other spectral/modal analysis method implemented in gpumd, such as the Green-Kubo modal
analysis method [59] and the Homogeneous non-equilibrium
modal analysis method [58], but we will not demonstrate
their usage in this tutorial.

NEP approach has been implemented in the open-source
gpumd package [25][,][26] . After compiling, there will be an
executable named `nep` that can be used to train _accu-_
_rate_ NEP models against reference data, and an executable named `gpumd` that can be used to perform _ef-_
_ficient_ MD simulations. The gpumd package is selfcontained, free from dependencies on third-party packages, particularly those related to ML. This makes the
installation of gpumd straightforward and effortless. In
addition, there are some handy (but not mandatory)
Python packages available to facilitate the pre-processing
and post-processing gpumd inputs and outputs, including calorine [182], gpyumd [183], gpumd-wizard [184], and
pynep [185] . Since its inception with the very first version
in 2013 [186], gpumd has been developed with special expertise in heat transport applications.


**A.** **The neuroevolution potential**


The NEP model is based on artificial neural network
(ANN) and is trained using a separable natural evolution _̸_
strategy (SNES) [187], hence the name.


_**1.**_ _**The NN model**_


The ML model in NEP is a fully-connected feedforward
ANN with a single hidden layer, which is also called a
multilayer perceptron. The total energy is the sum of
the site energies _U_ = [�] _i_ _[U]_ _[i]_ [, and the site energy] _[ U]_ _[i]_ [ is the]

output of the neural network (NN), expressed as:

layer, _ω_ _µ_ [(1)] is the connection weight vector from the hidden layer to the output layer, _b_ [(0)] _µ_ is the bias vector in
the hidden layer, and _b_ [(1)] is the bias in the output layer.
_ω_ _µν_ [(0)] [,] _[ ω]_ _µ_ [(1)] [,] _[ b]_ [(0)] _µ_ [, and] _[ b]_ [(1)] [ are trainable parameters. The]
function tanh( _x_ ) is the nonlinear activation function in
the hidden layer. According to Eq. (41), the NEP model
is a simple analytical function of a descriptor vector. A
C++ function for evaluating the energy and its derivative with respect to the descriptor components can be
found in Ref. 25.


_**2.**_ _**The descriptor**_


The descriptor _q_ _i_ _[ν]_ [encompasses the local environment]
of atom _i_ . In NEP, the descriptor is an abstract vector
whose components group into radial and angular parts.
The radial descriptor components _q_ _n_ _[i]_ [(0] _[ ≤]_ _[n][ ≤]_ _[n]_ [R] max [) are]
defined as

_q_ _n_ _[i]_ [=] � _g_ _n_ ( _r_ _ij_ ) _,_ (42)

_j_ = _̸_ _i_


where _r_ _ij_ is the distance between atoms _i_ and _j_ and
_g_ _n_ ( _r_ _ij_ ) are a set of radial functions, each of which is
formed by a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. The angular components include _n_ -body ( _n_ = 3 _,_ 4 _,_ 5)
correlations. For the 3-body part, the descriptor components are defined as (0 _≤_ _n ≤_ _n_ [A] max [, 1] _[ ≤]_ _[l][ ≤]_ _[l]_ max [3body] [)]


_q_ _nl_ _[i]_ [=] �( _−_ 1) _[m]_ _A_ _[i]_ _nlm_ _[A]_ _[i]_ _nl_ ( _−m_ ) [;] (43)

_j_ = _̸_ _i_


Here, _Y_ _lm_ are the spherical harmonics and ˆ _**r**_ _ij_ is the unit
vector of _**r**_ _ij_ . Note that the radial functions _g_ _n_ ( _r_ _ij_ ) for
the radial and angular descriptor components can have
different cutoff radii, which are denoted as _r_ c [R] [and] _[ r]_ c [A] [,]
respectively. For 4-body and 5-body descriptor components (with similar hyperparameters _l_ max [4body] and _l_ max [5body] as
in the 3-body part), see Ref. 25.

FIG. 4. Selected literature results on the application of
MLPs to thermal transport, covering a broad range of ma
142

terials, including liquid water [154], amorphous SiO 2, amor
78

phous silicon [152], crystalline silicon [74], crystalline CoSb 3,

and crystalline graphite [141] . Experimental data are from
Refs. 172 and 173 (liquid water), Refs. 174–176 (amorphous
SiO 2 ), Ref. 177 (amorphous silicon), Ref. 178 (crystalline silicon), Ref. 179 (crystalline CoSb 3 ), and Ref. 180 (crystalline
graphite).


_**3.**_ _**The training algorithm**_


The free parameters are optimized using the SNES by
minimizing a loss function that is a weighted sum of the
root-mean-square errors (RMSEs) of energy, force, and
virial stress, over _N_ gen generations with a population size
of _N_ pop . The weights for the energy, force, and virial are
denoted _λ_ e, _λ_ f, and _λ_ v, respectively. Additionally, there
are proper norm-1 ( _ℓ_ 1 ) and norm-2 ( _ℓ_ 2 ) regularization
terms. For explicit details on the training algorithm, refer
to Ref. 23.


_**4.**_ _**Combining with other potentials**_


Although NEP with proper hyperparameters can account for almost all types of interactions, it can be useful
to combine it with some well developed potentials, such
as the Ziegler-Biersack-Littmark (ZBL) [188] potential for


10



describing the extremely large screened nuclear repulsion at short interatomic distances and the D3 dispersion correction [189] for describing relatively long-range but
weak interactions. Both potentials have been recently
added to the gpumd package [168][,][190] It has been demonstrated that dispersion interactions can reduce the thermal conductivity of typical metal-organic frameworks by
about 10% [168] . With the addition of ZBL and D3, NEP
can then focus on describing the medium-range interactions.


**B.** **Model training and testing**


There are educational articles focusing on various best
practices in constructing MLPs [191][,][192] . Here we use crystalline silicon as a specific example to illustrate the particular techniques in the context of NEP.


_**1.**_ _**Prepare the initial training data**_


A training dataset is a collection of structures, each
characterized by a set of attributes:


1. a cell matrix defining a periodic domain


2. the species of the atoms in the cell


3. the positions of the atoms


4. the total energy of the cell of atoms


5. the force vector acting on each of the atoms


6. (optionally) the total virial tensor (with 6 independent components) of the cell


The structures can be prepared by any method, while the
energy, force, and virial are usually calculated via quantum mechanical methods, such as the DFT method. For
a dataset comprising _N_ str structures with a total number
of _N_ atoms, there are _N_ str energy data, 6 _N_ str virial data,
and 3 _N_ force data.
While there are already several publicly available training datasets for silicon, we opt to create one from scratch
for pedagogical purposes. The construction of training
dataset typically involves an iterative process, employing a scheme similar to active learning. The iterative
process begins with an initial dataset. To investigate
heat transport in crystalline silicon, the initial training
dataset should encompass structures relevant to the target temperatures and pressures. The most reliable way of
generating structures under these conditions is through
performing AIMD simulations, where interatomic forces
are calculated based on quantum mechanical methods,
such as the DFT approach. However, AIMD is computationally expensive (which is the primary motivation for
developing a MLP) and it is often impractical to perform
AIMD simulations for a dense grid of thermodynamic




conditions. Fortunately, there is usually no such need for
the purpose of generating the reference structures. Actually, manual perturbation of the atomic positions and/or
the cell matrices proves to be an effective way of generating useful reference structures.
Based on the considerations above, we generate the
initial training dataset through the following methods.
Firstly, we generate 50 structures by applying random
strains (ranging from _−_ 3% to +3% for each degree of
freedom) to the unit cell of cubic silicon (containing 8
atoms) while _simultaneously_ perturbing the atomic positions randomly (by 0.1 [˚] A). Secondly, we perform a 10-ps
AIMD simulation at 1000 K (fixed cell) using a 2 _×_ 2 _×_ 2
supercell of silicon crystal containing 64 atoms, and sample the structures every 0.1 ps, obtaining another 100
structures. In total, we obtain 150 structures and 6800
atoms initially.
After obtaining the structures, we perform singlepoint DFT calculations to obtain the reference energy, force and virial data. These data are saved
to a file named `train.xyz`, using the extended XYZ
format. The single-point DFT calculations are performed using the vasp package [193], using the PerdewBurke-Ernzerhof functional with the generalized gradient
approximation [194], a cutoff energy of 600 eV, an energy
convergence threshold of 10 _[−]_ [6] eV, and a _k_ -point mesh
of 4 _×_ 4 _×_ 4 for 64-atom supercells and 12 _×_ 12 _×_ 12 for
8-atom unit cells.


_**2.**_ _**Train the first NEP model**_


With the training data, we proceed to train our first
NEP model, denoted as NEP-iteration-1. For this task,
we need to prepare an input file named `nep.in` for the
`nep` executable in the gpumd package. This `nep.in`
input file contains the various hyperparameters for the
NEP model under training. Most hyperparameters have
well-suited default values, and for users initiating this
process, it is recommended to use these defaults whenever
applicable. The default values for key hyperparameters
are as follows:


1. _n_ [R] max [: 4]


2. _n_ [A] max [: 4]


3. Chebyshev polynomial basis size for radial descriptor components _N_ bas [R] [: 12]


4. Chebyshev polynomial basis size for angular descriptor components _N_ bas [A] [: 12]


5. _l_ max [3body] [: 4]


6. _l_ max [4body] [: 2]


7. _l_ max [5body] [: 0 (not used by default)]


8. _N_ neu : 30


11



9. Energy and force weights _λ_ e and _λ_ f : 1


10. Virial weight _λ_ v : 0.1


11. Batch size: 1000 (a large or even full batch is preferred for training with SNES)


12. Population size in SNES: 50


13. Number of training generations (steps): 100 000


14. ANN architecture: 30-30-1 (input layer 30, hidden
layer 30, scalar output; relatively small but sufficient for most cases, expect for very complicated
training data.)


Following this strategy, we use a very simple `nep.in`
input file for our case, which is as follows:

```
type 1 Si
cutoff 5 5

```

In the first line, we specify the number of species (atom
types) and the chemical symbol(s). In our example, there
is only one species with the chemical symbol Si. In the
second line, we specify the cutoff radii _r_ c [R] [and] _[ r]_ c [A] [for]
the _g_ _n_ ( _r_ _ij_ ) functions in the radial and angular descriptor components, respectively. In our example, both cutoff radii are set to 5 A, which includes the third nearest [˚]
neighbors. The choice of cutoff radii is crucial for the performance of the trained NEP model and usually requires
a systematic exploration to find an optimal set of values.
It is important to note that the average number of neighbors, and hence the computational cost, scales cubically
with respect to the cutoff radii. Therefore, blindly using
large cutoff radii is not advisable. Although _r_ c [R] [=] _[ r]_ c [A] [in]
our current example, it is generally beneficial to use a
larger _r_ c [R] [and a smaller] _[ r]_ c [A] [, because the radial descriptor]
components are computationally much cheaper than the
angular descriptor components. Using a larger _r_ c [R] [does]
not lead to a significant increase in the computational
cost, but can help capture longer-range interactions (such
as screened Coulomb interactions in ionic compounds [23] )
that typically have little angular dependence. A larger
radial cutoff is also useful for capturing dispersion interactions in Van der Waals structures [141] .
The training results for NEP-iteration-1 are shown in
Fig. 5(a). The RMSEs of force, energy, and virial all
converge well within the default 100 000 training steps.
The parity plots for force, energy, and virial in Figs. 5(b)5(d) show good correlations between the NEP predictions
and the DFT reference data. The RMSEs for energy,
force, and virial are 1.0 meV/atom, 54.6 meV/A, and [˚]
21.8 meV/atom, respectively .


_**3.**_ _**Training iterations**_


Reliable assessment of the accuracy of a MLP typically involves an independent test dataset rather than

the training dataset. To this end, we perform 10-ps MD
simulations using NEP-iteration-1 in the _NPT_ ensemble.
The target pressure is set to zero, and the target temperatures range from 100 K to 1000 K with intervals of 100
K. We sample 100 structures, totalling 6400 atoms.
We perform single-point DFT calculations for these
structures and then use NEP-iteration-1 to generate predictions. This is achieved by adding the `prediciton` keyword to the `nep.in` file:

```
type 1 Si
cutoff 5 5

prediction 1

```

This results in a rapid prediction for the test dataset. The
RMSEs for energy, force, and virial are 1.2 meV/atom,
41.6 meV/ [˚] A, and 8.5 meV/atom, respectively. These
values are already comparable to those for the training
dataset, indicating that we can actually stop here and
use NEP-iteration-1 as the final model. However, for
added confidence, it is generally advisable to perform at
least one more iteration. Therefore, we combine the test
dataset (100 structures) with the training dataset (150
structures) to form an expanded training dataset (250
structures), and then train a new model named NEPiteration-2. With this new NEP model, we generate
another test dataset with 100 structures, using similar
procedure as above but with a simulation time of 10 ns
(instead of 10 ps), driven by NEP-iteration-2 for each
temperature. The test RMSEs for NEP-iteration-2 are
0.5 meV/atom (energy), 33.5 meV/ [˚] A (force), and 8.9
meV/atom (virial), respectively. Both the energy and


12



force RMSEs are smaller than those for the previous iteration, indicating the improved performance of NEPiteration-2 compared to NEP-iteration-1.
The high accuracy of the latest test dataset sampled
from 10-ns MD simulations driven by NEP-iteration2 suggests that NEP-iteration-2 is a reliable model for
MD simulation of crystalline silicon from 100 to 1000
K. Therefore, we conclude the iteration and use NEPiteration-2 for the thermal transport applications. In
the following, we will refer to NEP-iteration-2 simply as
NEP. This NEP model, running on a consumer-grade
NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU card with 24 GB of memory, achieves a remarkable computational speed of about
2 _._ 4 _×_ 10 [7] atom-step/second, equivalent to a computational cost of about 4 _._ 2 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [8] s/atom/step in MD simulations.

Using a trained MLP to generate MD trajectory is a
common practice in nearly all the active-learning schemes
documented in the literature. The major difference between different active-learning schemes is about the criteria for selecting structures to be added to the training dataset. While there might be a risk of sampling
nonphysical structures using a trained MLP model, as
demonstrated in this tutorial, one can mitigate the risk
by conducting a few iterations and employing shorter
MD runs in the initial stages, progressively increasing
the MD simulation time with each iteration. As a result, the MLP becomes increasingly reliable throughout
the iteration process, enabling the generation of longer
and more accurate trajectories over time. In our example using the silicon crystal, a relatively simple system,
we only performed two iterations to achieve accurate predictions for 10-ns MD runs. However, for more complex
systems, one might need to perform more iterations, increasing the MD steps more gradually than what we have
demonstrated for the silicon crystal example.


**C.** **Thermal transport applications**


_**1.**_ _**Phonon dispersion relations**_


Before applying a MLP to thermal transport applications, it is usually a good practice to examine the phonon
dispersion relations. The phonon dispersion relations
for NEP and Tersoff [195] potentials are calculated using
gpumd, employing the finite-displacement method with
a displacement of 0.01 [˚] A. For DFT, we use density functional perturbation theory as implemented in vasp in
combination with phonopy [196], using a 4 _×_ 4 _×_ 4 supercell, a cutoff energy of 600 eV, an energy convergence
threshold of 10 _[−]_ [8] eV, and a 5 _×_ 5 _×_ 5 _k_ -point mesh.
In Fig. 6, we compare the phonon dispersion relations
calculated from DFT, Tersoff potential, and NEP. While
there are small differences between NEP and DFT results, the agreement between NEP and DFT is significantly better than that between Tersoff and DFT. The
agreement between NEP and DFT can, in principle, be

further improved, for example, by increasing the size of
the ANN model and/or the cutoff radii. However, this
comes with a trade-off, as it may reduce computational
efficiency. In practice, achieving a balance between accuracy and speed is essential.


_**2.**_ _**Thermal conductivity from EMD**_


After validating the phonon dispersion relations, we
proceed to thermal conductivity calculations using the
various MD methods, as reviewed in Sec. III. All calculations are performed using the `gpumd` executable in

gpumd.

We start with the EMD method, using a sufficiently
large 12 _×_ 12 _×_ 12 cubic supercell with 13 824 atoms.
The `run.in` file for the `gpumd` executable is configured as
follows:

```
potential nep.txt
velocity 300

ensemble npt_ber 300 300 100 0 53.4059 2000
time_step 1
dump_thermo 1000

run 500000

ensemble nve

compute_hac 20 50000 10

run 10000000

```

There are three input blocks. In the first block, we specify
the NEP potential file and set the initial temperature to
300 K. The second block represents an equilibration run
of 500 ps in the _NPT_ ensemble, aiming to reach a target
temperature of 300 K and a target pressure of zero. The
third block corresponds to a production run of 10 ns in


13



the _NV E_ ensemble, with heat current sampled every 20
steps.
We perform 50 independent runs using the inputs
above, each with a different set of initial velocities. The
_κ_ ( _t_ ) [cf. Eq. (26)] results from individual runs (thin
solid lines) and their average (thick solid line) and error
bounds (thick dashed lines) are shown in Fig. 7(a). Taking _t_ = 1 ns as the upper limit of the correlation time,
up to which _κ_ ( _t_ ) converges well, we have _κ ≈_ 102 _±_ 6
Wm _[−]_ [1] K _[−]_ [1] from the EMD method. In this work, all statistical errors are calculated as the standard error of the

mean.

_**3.**_ _**Thermal conductivity from HNEMD**_


We then move to the HNEMD method. Since the
HNEMD method has the same finite-size effects as in the
EMD method, we use the same simulation cell as in the
EMD method. The `run.in` file for the `gpumd` executable
reads as follows:

```
potential nep.txt
velocity 300

ensemble npt_ber 300 300 100 0 53.4059 2000

```



```
time_step 1
dump_thermo 1000

run 1000000

compute_hnemd 1000 2e-5 0 0
compute_shc 2 250 0 1000 120
dump_thermo 1000

run 10000000

```

There are also three input blocks, and only the production block differs from the case of EMD. Here, the temperature is controlled using the Nose-Hoover chain thermostat, and an external force in the _x_ direction with
_F_ e = 2 _×_ 10 _[−]_ [5] [ ˚] A _[−]_ [1] is applied. The production run has
10 ns in total.
We perform 4 independent runs using the specified inputs, each with a different set of initial velocities. The
_κ_ ( _t_ ) [cf. Eq. (34)] results from individual runs (thin
solid lines) and their average (thick solid line) and error bounds (thick dashed lines) are shown in Fig. 7(b).
The estimated thermal conductivity is _κ ≈_ 108 _±_ 4
Wm _[−]_ [1] K _[−]_ [1], consistent with the EMD value within statistical error bounds. It is noteworthy that the total production time for the HNEMD simulations (4 _×_ 10 ns)
is considerably smaller than that for the EMD simulations (50 _×_ 10 ns), while the former still gives a smaller
statistical error. This suggests a higher computational
efficiency of the HNEMD over the EMD method, as previously emphasized [54] .
From the HNEMD simulations, we also obtain the
spectral thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _ω_ ) [cf. Eq. (39)]. By
combining this with the spectral conductance _G_ ( _ω_ ) [cf.
Eq. (37)] in a ballistic NEMD simulation (details provided below), we calculate the phonon MFP spectrum

as

_λ_ ( _ω_ ) = _[κ]_ [(] _[ω]_ [)] (45)

_G_ ( _ω_ ) _[,]_


which is a generalization of Eq. (8). The calculated _λ_ ( _ω_ )
is shown in Fig. 7(c). Remarkably, in the low-frequency
limit, _λ_ ( _ω_ ) can go well beyond one micron. With _κ_ ( _ω_ )
and _λ_ ( _ω_ ), one can calculate the spectral apparent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _ω, L_ ) according to Eq. (10) and obtain the apparent thermal conductivity at _any_ length _L_
using Eq. (11). The results are depicted by the solid line
in Fig. 7(d).


_**4.**_ _**Thermal conductivity from NEMD**_


The third MD method we demonstrate is the NEMD
method, using the fixed boundary setup discussed in
Sec. II C 2. We explore lengths _L_ = 2.7, 5.5, 11.0, 21.9,
43.8, 87.6, 175.3, 350.5 nm, maintaining a consistent 5 _×_ 5
cell in the transverse direction. The heat source and sink
regions span 4.4 nm, which is long enough to ensure fully
thermalized phonons within these regions. The `run.in`
input file for our NEMD simulations reads as follows:


14


```
potential nep.txt
velocity 300

ensemble nvt_ber 300 300 100

time_step 1

fix 0

dump_thermo 100

run 100000

ensemble heat_lan 300 100 10 1 7

fix 0

compute 0 10 100 temperature
compute_shc 2 250 0 1000 120.0 group 0 4

run 2000000

```

Unlike the EMD and HNEMD simulations, the NEMD
simulations involve an extra operation: certain atoms are
frozen. We assign these atoms to the “group” 0 and use
the `fix 0` command to freeze them. In the production
stage, two Langevin thermostats with different temperatures are applied separately to groups 1 and 7, corresponding to the heat source and the heat sink, respectively. The temperature difference between them is set
to 20 K. The heat flux can be obtained from the data
produced by the `compute` keyword, allowing us to calculate the apparent thermal conductivity _κ_ ( _L_ ) according
to Eq. (29). The production stage has a duration of 2
ns, with a well-established steady state achieved within
the first 1 ns. Therefore, we use the second half of the
production time to calculated the aforementioned steadstate properties. For each system length, we perform 2
independent runs, each with a different set of initial velocities. To get the spectral conductance _G_ ( _ω_ ) in the ballistic limit, as used in Eq. (45), we use the data produced
by the `compute_shc` keyword in NEMD simulations with
a short system length of _L_ = 1.6 nm.


As expected, the _κ_ ( _L_ ) values from NEMD simulations
match well with the _κ_ ( _L_ ) curve from the HNEMD-based
formalism [Fig. 7(d)]. However, reaching the diffusive
limit directly through NEMD simulations is computationally demanding. Considering the presence of different
phonon MFPs [Fig. 7(c)] in the system, linear extrapolation to the diffusive limit based on a limited number
of _κ_ ( _L_ ) values from NEMD simulations is often inadequate. This limitation arises because the relation between 1 _/κ_ ( _L_ ) and 1 _/L_ becomes nonlinear in the large- _L_
limit (see Fig. 8). This nonlinearity is a general feature in
realistic materials, as also demonstrated in our toy model

[Fig. 2(d)].


As of now, we have demonstrated the full consistency among the three MD-based methods. Notably, the
HNEMD method stands out as the most computationally efficient. This explains why most works based on
gpumd utilize the HNEMD method, with the other two
methods typically being employed primarily for sanitychecking the results.

_**5.**_ _**Comparison with experiments**_


After obtaining consistent results from three MD
methods, we are ready to compare the results with experimental data. The thermal conductivity of crystalline
silicon is measured to be about 150 W m _[−]_ [1] K _[−]_ [1], but our
HNEMD simulations predict a value of 108 _±_ 4 W m _[−]_ [1]

K _[−]_ [1], which is only 72% of the experimental value. As a
comparison, the thermal conductivity of crystalline silicon has been calculated [197] to be about 250 _±_ 10 W m _[−]_ [1]

K _[−]_ [1] using a Tersoff potential [195], which is 167% of the
experimental value. Specifically, the Tesoff potential appears to underestimate the phonon anharmonicity, while
the NEP model tends to overestimate it.
According to a recent unpublished study by Wu _et_
_al._ [181], the underestimation of thermal conductivity by
MLPs could potentially be attributed to small but finite force errors compared to the reference data, leading to extra phonon scatterings. Based on the fact that
the force errors form a Gaussian distribution, similar to
the random forces in the Langevin thermostat, a method
for correcting the force-error-induced underestimation
of the thermal conductivity from MLPs is proposed [181] .
This correction involves conducting a series of HNEMD
simulations with the temperature being controlled by a
Langevin thermostat with various relaxation times _τ_ _T_ .
Each component of the random force follows a Gaussian
distribution with zero mean and a variance of

_σ_ lan [2] [=] [2] _τ_ _[k]_ _T_ [B] ∆ _[Tm]_ _t_ _[,]_ (46)


where _m_ is the average atom mass in the system and ∆ _t_
is the integration time step. When the random forces
in the Langevin thermostat and the force errors in the
MLP (with a RMSE of _σ_ mlp at a particular temperature)

created, with a larger variance given by


2 2 2
_σ_ tot = _σ_ lan + _σ_ mlp _,_ (47)


according to the properties of Gaussian distribution. After obtaining _κ_ ( _σ_ tot ) at different _σ_ tot, the thermal conductivity with zero total force error _κ_ ( _σ_ tot = 0) can be
obtained from the following relation [181] :


1 1
(48)
_κ_ ( _σ_ tot ) [=] _κ_ ( _σ_ tot = 0) [+] _[ βσ]_ [tot] _[,]_


where _β_ is a fitting parameter.
Based on the correction method, we perform HNEMD
simulations using the Langevin thermostat with the following set of _τ_ _T_ values: 30, 50, 100, 200, and 500 ps.
From these, the _σ_ L values are calculated to be 17.3, 27.4
38.7 54.8, and 70.7 meV/A. At 300 K, the force RMSE [˚]
for our NEP model is tested to be _σ_ mlp = 21.2 meV/A. [˚]
Therefore, the resulting _σ_ tot values are 27.4, 34.6, 44.2,
58.7, and 73.8 meV/A. To ensure consistency with exper- [˚]
imental conditions, we also account for the presence of a
few Si isotopes (92.2% [28] Si, 4.7% [29] Si, and 3.1% [30] Si) in




the calculations. The calculated _κ_ ( _σ_ tot ) with the various
_σ_ tot are shown in Fig. 9(a). By fitting these data, we
obtain a corrected thermal conductivity of _κ_ ( _σ_ tot = 0) =
145 W m _[−]_ [1] K _[−]_ [1], in excellent agreement with the experimental value.
The extrapolation scheme described by Eq. (48) not
only applies to a single NEP model with different levels of
intentionally added random forces through the Langevin
thermostat, but is also valid for different NEP models
with varying accuracy. To demonstrate this, we construct
two extra NEP models with reduced accuracy. Starting
from the default hyperparameters, we construct the first
extra NEP model by reducing the number of neurons in
the hidden layer from 30 to 1, resulting in an increased
force RMSE of 32.4 meV/A. Based on this, we then con- [˚]
struct the second extra NEP model by further reducing
the Chebyshev polynomial basis sizes ( _N_ bas [R] [,] _[ N]_ bas [ A] [) from]
(12 _,_ 12) to (4 _,_ 4), resulting in a further increased force
RMSE of 52.9 meV/A. The thermal conductivity results [˚]
from the three NEP models with different accuracy using
the Nos´e-Hoover chain thermostat also closely follow the
extrapolation curve [Fig. 9(a)], providing further support
for the validity of the extrapolation scheme Eq. (48).
Our results for 300 K before and after the correction are consistent with those reported in the previous work [181], which also uses a NEP model [Fig. 9(b)].
In Fig. 9(b), we also show the results for other
temperatures [181] in comparison to the experimental data.
The corrected results agree well with the experimental
ones across a broad range of temperatures. The slightly
higher values from corrected NEP model predictions are
likely due to the fact that isotope disorder was not considered in the previous calculations [181] .
While we have only demonstrated the application of
the extrapolation (correction) method to HNEMD simulations, it is worth noting that this method is also potentially applicable to EMD simulations. We speculate
that the force errors in MLPs may also play a role in
ALD-based approaches for thermal transport.


**V.** **SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS**


In summary, we have provided a comprehensive pedagogical introduction to MD simulations of thermal transport utilizing the NEP MLP as implemented in the
gpumd package.
We began by reviewing fundamental concepts related
to thermal transport in both ballistic and diffusive
regimes, elucidating the explicit expression of the heat
flux in the context of MLPs, and exploring various MDbased methods for thermal transport studies, including
EMD, NEMD, HNEMD, and spectral decomposition.
Following this, we conducted an up-to-date review of
the literature on the application of MLPs in thermal
transport problems through MD simulations.
A detailed review of the NEP approach followed, with
a step-by-step demonstration of the process of developing


16



an accurate and efficient NEP model for crystalline silicon applicable across a range of temperatures. Utilizing
the developed NEP model, we explained the technical details of all MD-based methods for thermal transport discussed in this work. Finally, we compared the simulation
results with experimental data, addressing the common
trend of thermal conductivity underestimation by MLPs
and demonstrating an effective correction method.
By completing this tutorial, readers will be equipped
to construct MLPs and seamlessly integrate them into
highly efficient and predictive MD simulations of heat
transport.

**Appendix A: Details on heat current validation**


To validate the implementation of heat current for
NEP, DP, and MTP [see Fig. 3], we use a common reference dataset to train a model for each of the three MLPs.
We take all the monolayer graphene structures from Ref.
67 and use 3288 structures (99 493 atoms) as our training dataset and 822 structures (25 035 atoms) as our test
dataset, respectively.
For NEP, we set _r_ c [R] [= 6 ˚A,] _[ r]_ c [A] [= 4 ˚A,] _[ N]_ [neu] [= 50,]
_N_ gen = 5 _×_ 10 [5], while keeping other hyperparameters as
the defaults. For DP, the deepmd-kit package (version
2.1.4) [21] is used, with the `se_a` descriptor with a cutoff




radius of 6 [˚] A. The dimensions of the embedding network are set to (25, 50, 100), and the fitting network
dimensions are configured as (240, 240, 240). Initially,
the weighting parameters for energy and forces are set
to 0.02 and 1000, respectively, and are linearly adjusted
to 1 for both during the training process. The training comprises 4 _×_ 10 [6] steps, with a learning rate that is
exponentially decreased from 10 _[−]_ [3] to 10 _[−]_ [8] . For MTP,
the mlip (version 2) package [20] is used. The descriptor
“level” for MTP is set to 18, with a cutoff radius of 6 A. [˚]
Table III presents the performance metrics for the three
MLP models.


TABLE III. Comparison of the energy and force RMSEs
and computational speed for MTP, DP (after model compression), and NEP. The computational speed is assessed by
running MD simulations for 10 [5] steps in the _NV T_ ensemble
for a graphene system containing 24 800 atoms, using gpumd
(NEP) or lammps [32] with version 23 Jun 2022 (MTP and DP).
For GPU-based tests (DP and NEP), a single Nvidia RTX
3090 is used; for CPU-based tests (MTP), 64 AMD EPYC
7H12 cores are used.


Model MTP DP NEP
Energy-train (meV/atom) 2.4 1.4 1.8
Energy-test (meV/atom) 2.2 1.4 1.9

Force-test (meV/A) [˚] 116 78 89

We then conduct NEMD simulations to validate the
implementations of heat current in the three MLPs by
checking the consistency between the accumulated heat
in atoms within the transport region [cf. Eq. (25)] and
that obtained from the thermostats [cf. Eq. (31)]. The
NEMD simulation procedure is similar to that as described in Sec. IV C 4 for silicon. The transport is set
to be along the armchair direction of a graphene sample
with a width of 2.5 nm and a length of 426 nm (excluding the thermostatted regions). The data presented in
Fig. 3 are sampled during the last 1.5 ns of the NEMD
simulations, during which a steady state is achieved.
